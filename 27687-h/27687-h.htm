<h2><a name="TRANSCRIBERS_NOTES" id="TRANSCRIBERS_NOTES"></a>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES</h2>

<p>The author of this book used the spellings "aline," "gage," and "hight"
for the conventional spellings "align," "gauge," and "height." As they
are used consistently and do not affect the sense, they have been left
unchanged. Some obvious typos and misspellings that do not affect the sense
have been silently corrected. The following substantive typographical
errors have been corrected:
"being" to "bearing" (p. <a href="#Page_68">68</a>);
"FIG. 50" to "FIG. 56" (p. <a href="#Page_91">91</a>),
and "Fig. 2" to "Fig. 73" (p. <a href="#Page_159">159</a>).
Two other likely errors have been left as queries:
lead/load on p. <a href="#Page_142">142</a>
and beating/heating on p. <a href="#Page_177">177</a>.
These five changes are indentified by
dotted red underlining with pop-up titles.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> issue of the Power Handbook attempts to
give a compact manual for the engineer who feels the
need of acquainting himself with steam turbines. To
accomplish this within the limits of space allowed, it
has been necessary to confine the work to the description
of a few standard types, prepared with the
assistance of the builders. Following this the practical
experience of successful engineers, gathered from
the columns of <i>Power</i>, is given. It is hoped that the
book will prove of value to all engineers handling
turbines, whether of the described types or not.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Of</span> the making of books there is no end." This
seems especially true of steam-turbine books, but the
book which really appeals to the operating engineer,
the man who may have a turbine unloaded, set up,
put in operation, and the builders' representative out
of reach before the man who is to operate it fully
realizes that he has a new type of prime mover on
his hands, with which he has little or no acquaintance,
has not been written. There has been much published,
both descriptive and theoretical, about the turbine,
but so far as the writer knows, there is nothing in
print that tells the man on the job about the details
of the turbine in plain language, and how to handle
these details when they need handling. The operating
engineer does not care why the moving buckets
are made of a certain curvature, but he does care
about the distance between the moving bucket and
the stationary one, and he wants to know how to
measure that distance, how to alter the clearance,
if necessary, to prevent rubbing. He doesn't care
anything about the area of the step-bearing, but he
does want to know the way to get at the bearing to
take it down and put it up again, etc.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>The lack of literature along this line is the writer's
apology for what follows. The Curtis 1500-kilowatt
steam turbine will be taken first and treated "from
the ground up."</p>

<p>On entering a turbine plant on the ground floor, the
attention is at once attracted by a multiplicity of
pumps, accumulators and piping. These are called
"auxiliaries" and will be passed for the present to
be taken up later, for though of standard types their
use is comparatively new in power-plant practice, and
the engineer will find that more interruptions of service
will come from the auxiliaries than from the
turbine itself.</p>


<h3>Builders' Foundation Plans Incomplete</h3>

<p>It is impractical for the manufacturers to make
complete foundation drawings, as they are not familiar
with the lay-out of pipes and the relative position of
other apparatus in the station. All that the manufacturers'
drawing is intended to do is to show the
customer where it will be necessary for him to locate
his foundation bolts and opening for access to the
step-bearing.</p>

<div class="center">

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
	<img src="images/i003.png"
		alt="FIG. 1"
		title="FIG. 1"
	/><br />
FIG. 1</p>
</div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#FIG_1">1</a> shows the builders' foundation drawing,
with the addition of several horizontal and radial tubes
introduced to give passage for the various pipes which
must go to the middle of the foundation. Entering
through the sides of the masonry they do not block
the passage, which must be as free as possible when
any work is to be done on the step-bearing, or lower
guide-bearing. Entering the passage in the foundation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
a large screw is seen passing up through a circular
block of cast iron with a 3/4-inch pipe passing through
it. This is the step-supporting screw. It supports
the lower half of the step-bearing, which in turn supports
the entire revolving part of the machine. It is
used to hold the wheels at a proper hight in the
casing, and adjust the clearance between the moving
and stationary buckets. The large block which with
its threaded bronze bushing forms the nut for the
screw is called the cover-plate, and is held to the
base of the machine by eight 1-1/2-inch cap-screws. On
the upper side are two dowel-pins which enter the
lower step and keep it from turning.
(See Figs. <a href="#FIG_2">2</a> and <a href="#FIG_3">3</a>.)</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">

</div>

<p>The step-blocks are very common-looking chunks
of cast iron, as will be seen by reference to Fig. <a href="#FIG_4">4</a>.
The block with straight sides (the lower one in the
illustration) has the two dowel holes to match the
pins spoken of, with a hole through the center threaded
for 3/4-inch pipe. The step-lubricant is forced up through
this hole and out between the raised edges in a film,
floating the rotating parts of the machine on a frictionless
disk of oil or water. The upper step-block has
two dowel-pins, also a key which fits into a slot across
the bottom end of the shaft.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">

	<img src="images/i007.png"
		alt="FIG. 4"
		title="FIG. 4"
	/><br />
FIG. 4</p>
</div>

<p>The upper side of the top block is counterbored to
fit the end of the shaft. The counterbore centers the
block. The dowel-pins steer the key into the key-way
across the end of the shaft, and the key compels
the block to turn with the shaft. There is also a
threaded hole in the under side of the top block. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
is for the introduction of a screw which is used to pull
the top block off the end of the shaft. If taken off
at all it must be pulled, for the dowel-pins, key and
counterbore are close fits. Two long bolts with threads
the whole length are used if it becomes necessary to
take down the step or other parts of the bottom of
the machine. Two of the bolts holding the cover-plate
in place are removed, these long bolts put in
their places and the nuts screwed up against the plate
to hold it while the remaining bolts are removed.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<h3>How to Lower Step-Bearings to Examine Them</h3>

<p>Now, suppose it is intended to take down the step-bearings
for examination. The first thing to do is to
provide some way of holding the shaft up in its place
while we take its regular support from under it. In
some machines, inside the base, there is what is called
a "jacking ring." It is simply a loose collar on the
shaft, which covers the holes into which four plugs
are screwed. These are taken out and in their places
are put four hexagonal-headed screws provided for the
purpose, which are screwed up. This brings the ring
against a shoulder on the shaft and then the cover-plate
and step may be taken down.</p>

<p>While all the machines have the same general appearance,
there are some differences in detail which may
be interesting. One difference is due to the sub-base
which is used with the oil-lubricated step-bearings.
This style of machine has the jacking ring spoken of,
while others have neither sub-base nor jacking ring,
and when necessary to take down the step a different
arrangement is used.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
	<img src="images/i009.png"
		alt="FIG. 5"
		title="FIG. 5"
	/><br />
FIG. 5</p>
</div>

<p>A piece of iron that looks like a big horseshoe (Fig. <a href="#FIG_5">5</a>)
is used to hold the shaft up. The flange that covers
the entrance to the exhaust base is taken off and a
man goes in with the horseshoe-shaped shim and an
electric light. Other men take a long-handled wrench
and turn up the step-screw until the man inside the
base can push the horseshoe shim between the shoulder
on the shaft and the guide-bearing casing. The men
on the wrench then back off and the horseshoe shim
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>supports the weight of the machine. When the shim
is in place, or the jacking ring set up, whichever the
case may be, the cover-plate bolts may be taken out,
the nuts on the long screws holding the cover in place.</p>

<p>The 3/4-inch pipe which passes up through the step-screw
is taken down and, by means of the nuts on the
long screws, the cover-plate is lowered about 2 inches.
Then through the hole in the step-screw a 3/4-inch rod
with threads on both ends is passed and screwed into
the top step; then the cover-plate is blocked so it
cannot rise and, with a nut on the lower end of the
3/4-inch rod, the top step is pulled down as far as it
will come. The cover-plate is let down by means of
the two nuts, and the top step-block follows. When
it is lowered to a convenient hight it can be examined,
and the lower end of the shaft and guide-bearing will
be exposed to view.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">
	<a id="FIG_6" name="FIG_6"></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
	<img src="images/i010.png"
		alt="FIG. 6"
		title="FIG. 6"
	/><br />
FIG. 6</p>
</div>

<p>The lower guide-bearing (Fig. <a href="#FIG_6">6</a>) is simply a sleeve
flanged at one end, babbitted on the inside, and slightly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>tapered on the outside where it fits into the base. The
flange is held securely in the base by eight 3/4-inch cap-screws.
Between the cap-screw holes are eight holes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>tapped to 3/4-inch, and when it is desired to take the
bearing down the cap-screws are taken out of the base
and screwed into the threaded holes and used as jacks
to force the guide-bearing downward. Some provision
should be made to prevent the bearing from
coming down "on the run," for being a taper fit it
has only to be moved about one-half inch to be free.
Two bolts, about 8 inches long, screwed into the holes
that the cap-screws are taken from, answer nicely, as
a drop that distance will not do any harm, and the
bearing can be lowered by hand, although it weighs
about 200 pounds.</p>

<p>The lower end of the shaft is covered by a removable
bushing which is easily inspected after the guide-bearing
has been taken down. If it is necessary to take
off this bushing it is easily done by screwing four 5/8-inch
bolts, each about 2 feet long, into the tapped
holes in the lower end of the bushing, and then pulling
it off with a jack. (See Fig. <a href="#FIG_7">7</a>.)</p>

<p>Each pipe that enters the passage in the foundation
should be connected by two unions, one as close to
the machine as possible and the other close to the
foundation. This allows the taking down of all piping
in the passage completely and quickly without disturbing
either threads or lengths.</p>

<h3>Studying the Blueprints</h3>

<p>Fig. <a href="#FIG_8">8</a> shows an elevation and part-sectional view
of a 1500-kilowatt Curtis steam turbine. If one should
go into the exhaust base of one of these turbines, all
that could be seen would be the under side of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
lower or fourth-stage wheel, with a few threaded holes
for the balancing plugs which are sometimes used.
The internal arrangement is clearly indicated by the
illustration, Fig. <a href="#FIG_8">8</a>. It will be noticed that each of
the four wheels has an upper and a lower row of buckets
and that there is a set of stationary buckets for each
wheel between the two rows of moving buckets. These
stationary buckets are called intermediates, and are
counterparts of the moving buckets. Their sole office
is to redirect the steam which has passed through the
upper buckets into the lower ones at the proper angle.</p>

<p>The wheels are kept the proper distance apart by
the length of hub, and all are held together by the large
nut on the shaft above the upper wheel. Each wheel
is in a separate chamber formed by the diaphragms
which rest on ledges on the inside of the wheel-case,
their weight and steam pressure on the upper side
holding them firmly in place and making a steam-tight
joint where they rest. At the center, where the hubs
pass through them, there is provided a self-centering
packing ring (Fig. <a href="#FIG_9">9</a>), which is free to move sidewise,
but is prevented from turning, by suitable lugs. This
packing is a close running fit on the hubs of the wheel
and is provided with grooves (plainly shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_9">9</a>)
which break up and diminish the leakage of steam
around each hub from one stage to the next lower.
Each diaphragm, with the exception of the top one,
carries the expanding nozzles for the wheel immediately below.</p>

</div>

<p>The expanding nozzles and moving buckets constantly
increase in size and number from the top
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>toward the bottom. This is because the steam volume
increases progressively from the admission to the exhaust
and the entire expansion is carried out in the
separate sets of nozzles, very much as if it were one
continuous nozzle; but with this difference, not all of
the energy is taken out of the steam in any one set of
nozzles. The idea is to keep the velocity of the steam
in each stage as nearly constant as possible. The
nozzles in the diaphragms and the intermediates do
not, except in the lowest stage, take up the entire
circumference, but are proportioned to the progressive
expansion of steam as it descends toward the condenser.</p>

<h3>Clearance</h3>

<p>While the machine is running it is imperative that
there be no rubbing contact between the revolving
and stationary parts, and this is provided for by the
clearance between the rows of moving buckets and the
intermediates. Into each stage of the machine a
2-inch pipe hole is drilled and tapped. Sometimes this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>opening is made directly opposite a row of moving
buckets as in Fig. <a href="#FIG_10">10</a>, and sometimes it is made opposite
the intermediate. When opposite a row of buckets,
it will allow one to see the amount of clearance between
the buckets and the intermediates, and between the
buckets and the nozzles. When drilled opposite the
intermediates, the clearance is shown top and bottom
between the buckets and intermediates. (See Fig. <a href="#FIG_11">11</a>.)
This clearance is not the same in all stages, but is
greatest in the fourth stage and least in the first. The
clearances in each stage are nearly as follows: First
stage, 0.060 to 0.080; second stage, 0.080 to 0.100;
third stage, 0.080 to 0.100; fourth stage, 0.080 to
0.200. These clearances are measured by what are
called clearance gages, which are simply taper slips
of steel about 1/2-inch wide accurately ground and
graduated, like a jeweler's ring gage, by marks about
1/2-inch apart; the difference in thickness of the gage is
one-thousandth of an inch from one mark to the next.</p>

<p>To determine whether the clearance is right, one of
the 2-inch plugs is taken out and some marking material,
such as red lead or anything that would be used
on a surface plate or bearing to mark the high spots
is rubbed on the taper gage, and it is pushed into the
gap between the buckets and intermediates as far as it
will go, and then pulled out, the marking on the gage
showing just how far in it went, and the nearest mark
giving in thousandths of an inch the clearance. This
is noted, the marking spread again, and the gage tried
on the other side, the difference on the gage showing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>whether the wheel is high or low. Whichever may be
the case the hight is corrected by the step-bearing
screw. The wheels should be placed as nearly in the
middle of the clearance space as possible. By some
operators the clearance is adjusted while running, in
the following manner: With the machine running at
full speed the step-bearing screw is turned until the
wheels are felt or heard to rub lightly. The screw is
marked and then turned in the opposite direction
until the wheel rubs again. Another mark is made
on the screw and it is then turned back midway
between the two marks. Either method is safe if practiced
by a skilful engineer. In measuring the clearance
by the first method, the gage should be used with
care, as it is possible by using too much pressure to
swing the buckets and get readings which could be
misleading. To an inexperienced man the taper
gages would seem preferable. In the hands of a man
who knows what he is doing and how to do it, a tapered
pine stick will give as satisfactory results as the most
elaborate set of hardened and ground clearance gages.</p>

<p>Referring back to Fig. <a href="#FIG_11">11</a>, at <i>A</i> is shown one of the
peep-holes opposite the intermediate in the third
stage wheel for the inspection of clearance. The taper
clearance gage is inserted through this hole both above
and below the intermediate, and the distance which
it enters registers the clearance on that side. This
sketch also shows plainly how the shrouding on the
buckets and the intermediates extends beyond the
sharp edges of the buckets, protecting them from
damage in case of slight rubbing. In a very few cases
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>wheels have been known to warp to such an extent
from causes that were not discovered until too late,
that adjustment would not stop the rubbing. In such
cases the shrouding has been turned or faced off by
a cutting-off tool used through the peep-hole.</p>


<h3>Carbon Packing Used</h3>

<p>Where the shaft passes through the upper head of
the wheel-case some provision must be made to prevent
steam from the first stage escaping. This is
provided for by carbon packing (Fig. <a href="#FIG_12">12</a>), which consists
of blocks of carbon in sets in a packing case bolted
to the top head of the wheel-case. There are three
sets of these blocks, and each set is made of two rings
of three segments each. One ring of segments breaks
joints with its mate in the case, and each set is separated
from the others by a flange in the case in which
it is held. In some cases the packing is kept from
turning by means of a link, one end of which is fastened
to the case and the other to the packing holder. Sometimes
light springs are used to hold the packing against
the shaft and in some the pressure of steam in the case
does this. There is a pipe, also shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_12">12</a>,
leading from the main line to the packing case, the
pressure in the pipe being reduced. The space between
the two upper sets of rings is drained to the third
stage by means of a three-way cock, which keeps the
balance between the atmosphere and packing-case
pressure. The carbon rings are fitted to the shaft
with a slight clearance to start with, and very soon get
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>a smooth finish, which is not only practically steam-tight
but frictionless.</p>

<div class="center">

	/><br />
FIG. 12</p>
</div>

<p>The carbon ring shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_12">12</a> is the older design.
The segments are held against the flat bearing surface
of the case by spiral springs set in brass ferrules. The
circle is held together by a bronze strap screwed and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
drawn together at the ends by springs. Still other
springs press the straps against the surface upon
which the carbon bears, cutting off leaks through
joints and across horizontal surfaces of the carbon.
The whole ring is prevented from turning by a connecting-rod
which engages a pin in the hole, like those
provided for the springs.</p>

<h3>The Safety-stop</h3>

<p>There are several designs of safety-stop or speed-limit
devices used with these turbines, the simplest
being of the ring type shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_13">13</a>. This consists
of a flat ring placed around the shaft between
the turbine and generator. The ring-type emergencies
are now all adjusted so that they normally run concentric
with the shaft, but weighted so that the center
of gravity is slightly displaced from the center. The
centrifugal strain due to this is balanced by helical
springs. But when the speed increases the centrifugal
force moves the ring into an eccentric position, when
it strikes a trigger and releases a weight which, falling,
closes the throttle and shuts off the steam supply. The
basic principle upon which all these stops are designed
is the same&mdash;the centrifugal force of a weight balanced
by a spring at normal speed.
Figs. <a href="#FIG_14">14</a>, <a href="#FIG_15">15</a>, and <a href="#FIG_16">16</a>
show three other types.</p>


<h3>The Mechanical Valve-Gear</h3>

<p>Fig. <a href="#FIG_17">17</a> shows plainly the operation of the mechanical
valve-gear. The valves are located in the steam chests,
which are bolted to the top of the casing directly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>over the first sets of expansion nozzles. The chests,
two in number, are on opposite sides of the machine.
The valve-stems extend upward through ordinary
stuffing-boxes, and are attached to the notched cross-heads
by means of a threaded end which is prevented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>from screwing in or out by a compression nut on the
lower end of the cross-head. Each cross-head is actuated
by a pair of reciprocating pawls, or dogs (shown
more plainly in the enlarged view, Fig. <a href="#FIG_18">18</a>), one of
which opens the valve and the other closes it. The
several pairs of pawls are hung on a common shaft
which receives a rocking motion from a crank driven
from a worm and worm-wheel by the turbine shaft.
The cross-heads have notches milled in the side in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
which the pawls engage to open or close the valve,
this engagement being determined by what are called
shield-plates, <i>A</i> (Fig. <a href="#FIG_18">18</a>), which are controlled by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>governor. These plates are set, one a little ahead of
the other, to obtain successive opening or closing of
the valves. When more steam is required the shield
plate allows the proper pawl to fall into its notch in
the cross-head and lift the valve from its seat. If
less steam is wanted the shield-plate rises and allows
the lower pawl to close the valve on the down stroke.</p>

<p>The valves, as can easily be seen, are very simple
affairs, the steam pressure in the steam chest holding
the valve either open or shut until it is moved by the
pawl on the rock-shaft. The amount of travel on
the rock-shaft is fixed by the design, but the proportionate
travel above and below the horizontal is
controlled by the length of the connecting-rods from
the crank to the rock-shaft. There are besides the
mechanical valve-gear the electric and hydraulic, but
these will be left for a future article.</p>


<h3>The Governor</h3>

<p>The speed of the machine is controlled by the automatic
opening and closing of the admission valves
under the control of a governor (Fig. <a href="#FIG_19">19</a>), of the spring-weighted
type attached directly to the top end of
the turbine shaft. The action of the governor depends
on the balance of force exerted by the spring, and
the centrifugal effort of the rectangular-shaped weights
at the lower end; the moving weights acting through
the knife-edge suspension tend to pull down the lever
against the resistance of the heavy helical spring.
The governor is provided with an auxiliary spring on
the outside of the governor dome for varying the speed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>while synchronizing. The tension of the auxiliary
spring is regulated by a small motor wired to the
switchboard. This spring should be used only to
correct slight changes in speed. Any marked change
should be corrected by the use of the large hexagonal
nut in the upper plate of the governor frame. This
nut is screwed down to increase the speed, and upward
to decrease it.</p>

<h3>The Stage Valves</h3>

<p>Fig. <a href="#FIG_20">20</a> represents one of the several designs of
stage valve, sometimes called the overload valve,
the office of which is to prevent too high pressure in
the first stage in case of a sudden overload, and to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>transfer a part of the steam to a special set of expanding
nozzles over the second-stage wheel. This valve
is balanced by a spring of adjustable tension, and is,
or can be, set to open and close within a very small
predetermined range of first-stage pressure. The
valve is <i>intended</i> to open and close instantly, and
to supply or cut off steam from the second stage,
without affecting the speed regulation or economy of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>operation. If any leaking occurs past the valve it
is taken care of by a drip-pipe to the third stage.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">

<p>The steam which passes through the automatic
stage valves and is admitted to the extra set of nozzles
above the second-stage wheel acts upon this wheel
just the same as the steam which passes through the
regular second-stage nozzles; <i>i.e.</i>, all the steam which
goes through the machine tends to hasten its speed,
or, more accurately, does work and <i>maintains</i> the speed
of the machine.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Contributed to <i>Power</i> by F. L. Johnson.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> some conditions of service the stage valve
in the Curtis turbine will not do what it is designed
to do. It is usually attached to the machine in such
manner that it will operate with, or a little behind,
in the matter of time, the sixth valve. The machine
is intended to carry full load with only the first bank
of five valves in operation, with proper steam pressure
and vacuum. If the steam pressure is under 150
pounds, or the vacuum is less than 28 inches, the sixth
valve may operate at or near full load, and also open
the stage valve and allow steam to pass to the second-stage
nozzles at a much higher rate of speed than the
steam which has already done some work in the first-stage
wheel. The tendency is to accelerate unduly
the speed of the machine. This is corrected by the
governor, but the correction is usually carried too far
and the machine slows down. With the stage valve
in operation, at a critical point the regulation is uncertain
and irregular, and its use has to be abandoned.
The excess first-stage pressure will then be taken care
of by the relief valve, which is an ordinary spring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>safety valve (not pop) which allows the steam to
blow into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The mechanical valve-gear does not often get out
of order, but sometimes the unexpected happens. The
shop man may not have properly set up the nuts on
the valve-stems; or may have fitted the distance bushings
between the shield plates too closely; the superheat
of the steam may distort the steam chest slightly
and produce friction that will interfere with the regulation.
If any of the valve-stems should become loose
in the cross-heads they may screw themselves either
in or out. If screwed out too far, the valve-stem
becomes too long and the pawl in descending will,
after the valve is seated, continue downward until it
has broken something. If screwed in, the cross-head
will be too low for the upper pawl to engage and the
valve will not be opened. This second condition is
not dangerous, but should be corrected. The valve-stems
should be made the right length, and all check-nuts
set up firmly. If for any purpose it becomes
necessary to "set the valves" on a 1500-kilowatt
mechanical gear, the operator should proceed in the
following manner.</p>


<h3>Setting the Valves of a 1500-Kilowatt Curtis Turbine</h3>

<p>We will consider what is known as the "mechanical"
valve-gear, with two sets of valves, one set of five
valves being located on each side of the machine.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">
	<a id="FIG_21" name="FIG_21"></a>
	<img src="images/i033.png"
		alt="FIG. 21"
		title="FIG. 21"
	/><br />
FIG. 21</p>
</div>

<p>In setting the valves we should first "throw out" all
pawls to avoid breakage in case the rods are not already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>of proper length, holding the pawls out by slipping the
ends of the pawl springs over the points of the pawls,
as seen in Fig. <a href="#FIG_21">21</a>. Then turn the machine slowly by
hand until the pawls on one set of valves are at their
highest point of travel, then with the valves wide
open adjust the drive-rods, <i>i.e.</i>, the rods extending
from the crank to the rock-shaft, so that there is 1/32
of an inch clearance (shown dotted in Fig. <a href="#FIG_17">17</a>, Chap. I)
at the point of opening of the pawls when they are
"in." (See Fig. <a href="#FIG_22">22</a>.) Then set up the check-nuts
on the drive-rod. Turn the machine slowly, until the
pawls are at their lowest point of travel. Then, with
the valves closed, adjust each <i>valve-stem</i> to give 1/32
of an inch clearance at the point of closing of the
pawls when they are "in," securely locking the check-nut
as each valve is set. Repeat this operation on
the other side of the machine and we are ready to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
adjust the governor-rods. (Valves cannot be set on
both sides of the machine at the same time, as the
pawls will not be in the same relative position, due to
the angularity of the drive-rods.)</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">
	<a id="FIG_22" name="FIG_22"></a>

	</a><br />
FIG. 22</p>
</div>

<p>Next, with the turbine running, and the synchronizing
spring in mid-position, adjust the governor-rods
so that the turbine will run at the normal speed of
900 revolutions per minute when working on the fifth
valve, and carrying full load. The governor-rods for
the other side of the turbine (controlling valves Nos. 6
to 10) should be so adjusted that the speed change
between the fifth and sixth valves will not be more
than three or four revolutions per minute.</p>

<p>The valves of these turbines are all set during the
shop test and the rods trammed with an 8-inch tram.
Governors are adjusted for a speed range of 2 per
cent. between no load and full load (1500 kilowatt),
or 4 per cent. between the mean speeds of the first
and tenth valves (no load to full overload capacity).</p>

<p>The rods which connect the governor with the valve-gear
have ordinary brass ends or heads and are
adjusted by right-and-left threads and secured by lock-nuts.
They are free fits on the pins which pass through
the heads, and no friction is likely to occur which will
interfere with the regulation, but too close work on
the shield-plate bushings, or a slight warping of the
steam chest, will often produce friction which will
seriously impair the regulation. If it is noticed that
the shield-plate shaft has any tendency to oscillate
in unison with the rock-shaft which carries the pawls,
it is a sure indication that the shield-plates are not as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>free as they should be, and should be attended to.
The governor-rod should be disconnected, the pawls
thrown out and the pawl strings hooked over the ends.</p>

<p>The plates should then be rocked up and down by
hand and the friction at different points noted. The
horizontal rod at the back of the valve-gear may be
loosened and the amount of end play of each individual
shield-plate noticed and compared with the bushings
on the horizontal rod at the back which binds the
shield-plates together. If the plates separately are
found to be perfectly free they may be each one pushed
hard over to the right or left and wedged; then each
bushing tried in the space between the tail-pieces of
the plates. It will probably be found that the bushings
are not of the right length, due to the alteration
of the form of the steam chest by heat. It will generally
be found also that the bushings are too short,
and that the length can be corrected by very thin
washers of sheet metal. It has been found in some
instances that the thin bands coming with sectional
pipe covering were of the right thickness.</p>

<p>After the length of the bushings is corrected the
shield-plates may be assembled, made fast and tested
by rocking them up and down, searching for signs of
sticking. If none occurs, the work has been correctly
done, and there will be no trouble from poor regulation
due to friction of the shield-plates.</p>


<h3>The Baffler</h3>

<p>The water which goes to the step-bearing passes
through a baffler, the latest type of which is shown by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Fig. <a href="#FIG_23">23</a>. It is a device for restricting the flow of water
or oil to the step- and guide-bearing. The amount
of water necessary to float the machine and lubricate
the guide-bearing having been determined by calculation
and experiment, the plug is set at that point
which will give the desired flow. The plug is a square-threaded
worm, the length of which and the distance
which it enters the barrel of the baffler determining
the amount of flow. The greater the number of turns
which the water must pass through in the worm the
less will flow against the step-pressure.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>The engineers who have settled upon the flow and
the pressure decided that a flow of from 4-1/2 to 5-1/2
gallons per minute and a step-pressure of from 425
to 450 pounds is correct. These factors are so dependent
upon each other and upon the conditions of
the step-bearing itself that they are sometimes difficult
to realize in every-day work; nor is it necessary.
If the machine turns freely with a lower pressure than
that prescribed by the engineers, there is no reason
for raising this pressure; and there is only one way of
doing it without reducing the area of the step-bearing,
and that is by obstructing the flow of water in the
step-bearing itself.</p>

<p>A very common method used is that of grinding.
The machine is run at about one-third speed and the
step-water shut off for 15 or 20 seconds. This causes
grooves and ridges on the faces of the step-bearing
blocks, due to their grinding on each other, which
obstruct the flow of water between the faces and thus
raises the pressure. It seems a brutal way of getting
a scientific result, if the result desired can be called
scientific. The grooving and cutting of the step-blocks
will not do any harm, and in fact they will aid
in keeping the revolving parts of the machine turning
about its mechanical center.</p>

<p>The operating engineer will be very slow to see the
utility of the baffler, and when he learns, as he will
sometime, that the turbine will operate equally well
with a plug out as with it in the baffler, he will be inclined
to remove the baffler. It is true that with
one machine operating on its own pump it is possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>to run without the baffler, and it is also possible that
in some particular case two machines having identical
step-bearing pressures might be so operated. The
baffler, however, serves a very important function, as
described more fully as follows: It tends to steady
the flow from the pump, to maintain a constant oil
film as the pressure varies with the load, and when
several machines are operating on the same step-bearing
system it is the only means which fixes the flow to
the different machines and prevents one machine from
robbing the others. Therefore, even if an engineer
felt inclined to remove the baffler he would be most
liable to regret taking such a step.</p>

<p>If the water supply should fail from any cause and
the step-bearing blocks rub together, no great amount
of damage will result. The machine will stop if operated
long under these conditions, for if steam pressure
is maintained the machine will continue in operation
until the buckets come into contact, and if the step-blocks
are not welded together the machine may be
started as soon as the water is obtained. If vibration
occurs it will probably be due to the rough treatment
of the step-blocks, and may be cured by homeopathic
repeat-doses of grinding, say about 15 seconds each.
If the step-blocks are welded a new pair should be
substituted and the damaged ones refaced.</p>

<p>Some few experimental steps of spherical form,
called "saucer" steps, have been installed with success
(see Fig. <a href="#FIG_24">24</a>). They seem to aid the lower guide-bearing
in keeping the machine rotating about the
mechanical center and reduce the wear on the guide-bearing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>In some instances, too, cast-iron bushings
have been substituted for bronze, with marked success.
There seems to be much less wear between
cast-iron and babbitt metal than between bronze and
babbitt metal. The matter is really worth a thorough
investigation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Fig. <a href="#FIG_25">25</a> may be seen the interior construction of
the steam turbine built by Allis-Chalmers Co., of Milwaukee,
Wis., which is, in general, the same as the

<p>Fig. <a href="#FIG_26">26</a> is a longitudinal cross-section cut of rotor
and both lower and upper casing. Referring to Fig. <a href="#FIG_26">26</a>
the steam comes in from the steam-pipe at <i>C</i> and
passes through the main throttle or regulating valve
<i>D</i>, which is a balanced valve operated by the governor.
Steam enters the cylinder through the passage <i>E</i>.</p>

<p>Turning in the direction of the bearing <i>A</i>, it passes
through alternate stationary and revolving rows of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>blades, finally emerging at <i>F</i> and going out by way of
<i>G</i> to the condenser or to atmosphere. <i>H</i>, <i>J</i>, and <i>K</i>
represent three stages of blading. <i>L</i>, <i>M</i>, and <i>Z</i> are
the balance pistons which counterbalance the thrust
on the stages <i>H</i>, <i>J</i>, and <i>K</i>. <i>O</i> and <i>Q</i> are equalizing
pipes, and for the low-pressure balance piston similar
provision is made by means of passages (not shown)
through the body of the spindle.</p>

<p><i>R</i> indicates a small adjustable collar placed inside
the housing of the main bearing <i>B</i> to hold the spindle
in a position where there will be such a clearance
between the rings of the balance pistons and those of
the cylinder as to reduce the leakage of steam to a
minimum and at the same time prevent actual contact
under varying temperature.</p>

<p>At <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> are glands which provide a water seal
against the inleakage of air and the outleakage of
steam. <i>U</i> represents the flexible coupling to the
generator. <i>V</i> is the overload or by-pass valve used
for admitting steam to intermediate stage of the turbine.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span><i>W</i> is the supplementary cylinder to contain
the low-pressure balance piston. <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are reference
letters used in text of this chapter to refer to
equalizing of steam pressure on the low-pressure
stage of the turbine. The first point to study in this
construction is the arrangement of "dummies" <i>L</i>, <i>M</i>,
and <i>Z</i>. These dummy rings serve as baffles to prevent
steam leakage past the pistons, and their contact
at high velocity means not only their own destruction,
but also damage to or the wrecking of surrounding
parts. A simple but effective method of eliminating
this difficulty is found in the arrangement illustrated
in this figure. The two smaller balance pistons, <i>L</i>
and <i>M</i>, are allowed to remain on the high-pressure
end; but the largest piston, <i>Z</i>, is placed upon the
low-pressure end of the rotor immediately behind the
last ring of blades, and working inside of the supplementary
cylinder <i>W</i>. Being backed up by the body of
the spindle, there is ample stiffness to prevent warping.
This balance piston, which may also be plainly
seen in Fig. <a href="#FIG_25">25</a>, receives its steam pressure from the
same point as the piston <i>M</i>, but the steam pressure,
equalized with that on the third stage of the blading,
<i>X</i>, is through holes in the webs of the blade-carrying
rings. Entrance to these holes is through the small
annular opening in the rotor, visible in Fig. <a href="#FIG_25">25</a> between
the second and third barrels. As, in consequence of
varying temperatures, there is an appreciable difference
in the endwise expansion of the spindle and cylinder,
the baffling rings in the low-pressure balance
piston are so made as to allow for this difference.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>The high-pressure end of the spindle being held by
the collar bearing, the difference in expansion manifests
itself at the low-pressure end. The labyrinth
packing of the high-pressure and intermediate pistons
has a small axial and large radial clearance,
whereas the labyrinth packing of the piston <i>Z</i> has,
vice versa, a small radial and large axial clearance.
Elimination of causes of trouble with the low-pressure
balance piston not only makes it possible to
reduce the diameter of the cylinder, and prevent distortion,
but enables the entire spindle to be run with
sufficiently small clearance to obviate any excessive
leakage of steam.</p>


<h3>Detail of Blade Construction</h3>

<p>In this construction the blades are cut from drawn
stock, so that at its root it is of angular dovetail shape,
while at its tip there is a projection. To hold the
roots of the blades firmly, a foundation ring is provided,
as shown at <i>A</i> in Fig. <a href="#FIG_27">27</a>. This foundation
ring is first formed to a circle of the proper diameter,
and then slots are cut in it. These slots are accurately
spaced and inclined to give the right pitch and angle
to the blades (Fig. <a href="#FIG_28">28</a>), and are of dovetail shape to
receive the roots of the blades. The tips of the blades
are substantially bound together and protected by
means of a channel-shaped shroud ring, illustrated in
Fig. <a href="#FIG_31">31</a> and at <i>B</i> in Fig. <a href="#FIG_27">27</a>. Fig. <a href="#FIG_31">31</a> shows the cylinder
blading separate, and Fig. <a href="#FIG_27">27</a> shows both with the
shrouding. In these, holes are punched to receive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the projections on the tips of the blades, which are
rivetted over pneumatically.</p>

<div class="center">

		alt="FIG. 27"

	/><br />
FIG. 27</p>
</div>

<p>The foundation rings themselves are of dovetail
shape in cross-section, and, after receiving the roots
of the blades, are inserted in dovetailed grooves in
the cylinder and rotor, where they are firmly held in
place by keypieces, as may be seen at <i>C</i> in Fig. <a href="#FIG_27">27</a>.
Each keypiece, when driven in place, is upset into
an undercut groove, indicated by <i>D</i> in Fig. <a href="#FIG_27">27</a>, thereby
positively locking the whole structure together. Each
separate blade is firmly secured by the dovetail shape
of the root, which is held between the corresponding
dovetailed slot in the foundation ring and the undercut
side of the groove.</p>

<p>The obviously thin flanges of the shroud rings are
purposely made in that way, so that, in case of accidental
contact between revolving and stationary
parts, they will wear away enough to prevent the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
blades from being ripped out. This protection, however,
is such that to rip them out a whole half ring
of blades must be sheared off at the roots. The
strength of the blading, therefore, depends not upon
the strength of an individual blade, but upon the combined
shearing strength of an entire ring of blades.</p>

<h3>The Governor</h3>

<p>Next in importance to the difference in blading and
balance piston construction, is the governing mechanism
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>used with these machines. This follows the well-known
Hartung type, which has been brought into
prominence, heretofore largely in connection with
hydraulic turbines; and the governor, driven directly
from the turbine shaft by means of cut gears working
in an oil bath, is required to operate the small, balanced
oil relay-valve only, while the two steam valves,
main and by-pass (or overload), are controlled by an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>oil pressure of about 20 pounds per square inch, acting
upon a piston of suitable size. In view of the fact
that a turbine by-pass valve opens only when the
unit is required to develop overload, or the vacuum
fails, a good feature of this governing mechanism is
that the valve referred to can be kept constantly in
motion, thereby preventing sticking in an emergency,
even though it be actually called into action
only at long intervals. Another feature of importance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>is that the oil supply to the bearings, as well as
that to the governor, can be interconnected so that
the governor will automatically shut off the steam if
the oil supply fails and endangers the bearings. This
mechanism is also so proportioned that, while responding
quickly to variations in load, its sensitiveness is
kept within such bounds as to secure the best results
in the parallel operation of alternators. The governor
can be adjusted for speed while the turbine is in
operation, thereby facilitating the synchronizing of
alternators and dividing the load as may be desired.</p>

<p>In order to provide for any possible accidental derangement
of the main governing mechanism, an
entirely separate safety or over-speed governor is
furnished. This governor is driven directly by the
turbine shaft without the intervention of gearing, and
is so arranged and adjusted that, if the turbine should
reach a predetermined speed above that for which the
main governor is set, the safety governor will come
into action and trip a valve which entirely shuts off
the steam supply, bringing the turbine to a stop.</p>


<h3>Lubrication</h3>

<p>Lubrication of the four bearings, which are of the
self-adjusting, ball and socket pattern, is effected by
supplying an abundance of oil to the middle of each
bearing and allowing it to flow out at the ends. The
oil is passed through a tubular cooler, having water
circulation, and pumped back to the bearings. Fig.
<a href="#FIG_33">33</a> shows the entire arrangement graphically and
much more clearly than can be explained in words.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
The oil is circulated by a pump directly operated
from the turbine, except where the power-house is
provided with a central oiling system. Particular
stress is laid by the builders upon the fact that it is
not necessary to supply the bearings with oil under
pressure, but only at a head sufficient to enable it to
run to and through the bearings; this head never
exceeding a few feet. With each turbine is installed
a separate direct-acting steam pump for circulating
oil for starting up. This will be referred to again
under the head of operating.</p>

<h3>Generator</h3>

<p>The turbo-generator, which constitutes the electrical
end of this unit, is totally enclosed to provide
for noiseless operation, and forced ventilation is secured
by means of a small fan carried by the shaft on
each end of the rotor. The air is taken in at the ends
of the generator, passes through the fans and is discharged
over the end connections of the armature
coils into the bottom of the machine, whence it passes
through the ventilating ducts of the core to an opening
at the top. The field core is, according to size,
built up either of steel disks, each in one piece, or of
steel forgings, so as to give high magnetic permeability
and great strength. The coils are placed in radial
slots, thereby avoiding side pressure on the slot insulation
and the complex stresses resulting from centrifugal
force, which, in these rotors, acts normal to
the flat surface of the strip windings.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<h3>Operation</h3>

<p>As practically no adjustments are necessary when
these units are in operation, the greater part of the
attention required by them is involved in starting up
and shutting down, which may be described in detail
as follows:</p>

<p><i>To Start Up</i></p>

<p>First, the auxiliary oil pump is set going, and this
is speeded up until the oil pressure shows a hight
sufficient to lift the inlet valve and oil is flowing steadily
at the vents on all bearings. The oil pressure then
shows about 20 to 25 pounds on the "Relay Oil"
gage, and 2 to 4 pounds on the "Bearing Oil" gage.
Next the throttle is opened, without admitting sufficient
steam to the turbine to cause the spindle to
turn, and it is seen that the steam exhausts freely
into the atmosphere, also that the high-pressure end
of the turbine expands freely in its guides. Water
having been allowed to blow out through the steam-chest
drains, the drains are closed and steam is permitted
to continue flowing through the turbine not
less than a half an hour (unless the turbine is warm
to start with, when this period may be reduced) still
without turning the spindle. After this it is advisable
to shut off steam and let the turbine stand ten minutes,
so as to warm thoroughly, during which time
the governor parts may be oiled and any air which
may have accumulated in the oil cylinder above the
inlet valve blown off. Then the throttle should be
opened sufficiently to start the turbine spindle to revolving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>very slowly and the machine allowed to run in
this way for five minutes.</p>

<p>Successive operations may be mentioned briefly as
admitting water to the oil cooler; bringing the turbine
up to speed, at the same time slowing down the auxiliary
oil pump and watching that the oil pressures
are kept up by the rotary oil pump on the turbine;
turning the water on to the glands very gradually
and, before putting on vacuum, making sure that
there is just enough water to seal these glands properly;
and starting the vacuum gradually just before
putting on the load. These conditions having been
complied with, the operator next turns his attention
to the generator, putting on the field current, synchronizing
carefully and building up the load on the
unit gradually.</p>

<p>The principal precautions to be observed are not
to start without warming up properly, to make sure
that oil is flowing freely through the bearings, that
vacuum is not put on until the water glands seal, and
to avoid running on vacuum without load on the
turbine.</p>


<h3>In Operation</h3>

<p>In operation all that is necessary is to watch the
steam pressure at the "Throttle" and "Inlet" gages,
to see that neither this pressure nor the steam temperature
varies much; to keep the vacuum constant,
as well as pressures on the water glands and those
indicated by the "Relay Oil" and "Bearing Oil"
gages; to take care that the temperatures of the oil
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>flowing to and from the bearings does not exceed
135 degrees Fahr. (at which temperature the hand
can comfortably grasp the copper oil-return pipes);
to see that oil flows freely at all vents on the bearings,
and that the governor parts are periodically oiled.
So far as the generator is concerned, it is only essential
to follow the practice common in all electric power
plant operation, which need not be reviewed here.</p>

<p><i>Stopping the turbine</i> is practically the reverse of
starting, the successive steps being as follows: starting
the auxiliary oil pump, freeing it of water and allowing
it to run slowly; removing the load gradually;
breaking the vacuum when the load is almost zero,
shutting off the condenser injection and taking care
that the steam exhausts freely into the atmosphere;
shutting off the gland water when the load and vacuum
are off; pulling the automatic stop to trip the
valve and shut off steam and, as the speed of the
turbine decreases, speeding up the auxiliary oil pump
to maintain pressure on the bearings; then, when the
turbine has stopped, shutting down the auxiliary oil
pump, turning off the cooling water, opening the steam
chest drains and slightly oiling the oil inlet valve-stem.
During these operations the chief particulars
to be heeded are: not to shut off the steam before
starting the auxiliary oil pump nor before the vacuum
is broken, and not to shut off the gland water with
vacuum on the turbine. The automatic stop should
also remain unhooked until the turbine is about to
be started up again.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<h3>General</h3>

<p>Water used in the glands of the turbine must be
free from scale-forming impurities and should be
delivered at the turbine under a steady pressure of
not less than 15 pounds. The pressure in the glands
will vary from 4 to 10 pounds. This water may be
warm. In the use of water for the cooling coils and
of oil for the lubricating system, nothing more is
required than ordinary good sense dictates. An absolutely
pure mineral oil must be supplied, of a non-foaming
character, and it should be kept free through
filtering from any impurities.</p>

<p>The above refers particularly to Allis-Chalmers
turbines of the type ordinarily used for power service.
For turbines built to be run non-condensing, the part
relating to vacuum does not, of course, apply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the steam turbine is simple in design and
construction and does not require constant tinkering
and adjustment of valve gears or taking up of wear
in the running parts, it is like any other piece of fine
machinery in that it should receive intelligent and
careful attention from the operator by inspection of
the working parts that are not at all times in plain
view. Any piece of machinery, no matter how simple
and durable, if neglected or abused will in time come
to grief, and the higher the class of the machine the
more is this true.</p>

<p>Any engineer who is capable of running and intelligently
taking care of a reciprocating engine can run
and take care of a turbine, but if he is to be anything
more than a starter and stopper, it is necessary that
he should know what is inside of the casing, what must
be done and avoided to prevent derangement, and to
keep the machine in continued and efficient operation.</p>

<p>In the steam turbine the steam instead of being
expanded against a piston is made to expand against
and to get up velocity in itself. The jet of steam is

the moving orifice from which it issues, in either of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>which cases its velocity and energy are more or less
completely abstracted and appropriated by the revolving

<p>Fig. <a href="#FIG_34">34</a> is a sectional view of the standard Westinghouse-Parsons
single-flow turbine. A photograph of
the rotor <i>R R R</i> is reproduced in Fig. <a href="#FIG_35">35</a>, while in Fig.
<a href="#FIG_36">36</a> a section of the blading is shown upon a larger
scale. Between the rows of the blading upon the
rotor extend similar rows of stationary blades attached
to the casing or stator. The steam entering at <i>A</i>
(Fig. <a href="#FIG_34">34</a>), fills the circular space surrounding the rotor
and passes first through a row of stationary blades, 1
(Fig. <a href="#FIG_37">37</a>), expanding from the initial pressure <i>P</i> to
the slightly lower pressure <i>P</i><span class="sub">1</span>, and attaining by that
expansion a velocity with which it is directed upon
the moving blade 2. In passing through this row of
blades it is further expanded from pressure <i>P</i><span class="sub">1</span> to <i>P</i><span class="sub">2</span>
and helps to push the moving blades along by the reaction
of the force with which it issues therefrom. Impinging
upon the second row of stationary blades 3,
the direction of flow is diverted so as to make it impinge
at a favorable angle upon the second row of
revolving blades 4, and the action is continued until
the steam is expanded to the pressure of the condenser
or of the medium into which the turbine finally
exhausts. As the expansion proceeds, the passages
are made larger by increasing the length of the blades
and the diameter of the drums upon which they are
carried in order to accommodate the increasing volume.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that the blades shall run close
together, and the axial clearance, that is the space
lengthwise of the turbine between the revolving and
the stationary blades, varies from 1/8 to 1/2 inch; but in
order that there may not be excessive leakage over
the tops of the blades, as shown, very much exaggerated,
in Fig. <a href="#FIG_38">38</a>, the radial clearance, that is, the clearance
between the tops of the moving blades and the
casing, and between the ends of the stationary blades
and the shell of the rotor, must be kept down to the
lowest practical amount, and varies, according to the
size of the machine and length of blade, from about
0.025 to 0.125 of an inch.</p>

<p>In the passage <i>A</i> (Fig. <a href="#FIG_34">34</a>) exists the initial pressure;
in the passage <i>B</i> the pressure after the steam
has passed the first section or diameter of the rotor;
in the passage <i>C</i> after it has passed the second section.
The pressure acting upon the exposed faces
of the rows of vanes would crowd the rotor to the
left. They are therefore balanced by pistons or
"dummies" <i>P&nbsp;P&nbsp;P</i> revolving with the shaft and exposing
in the annular spaces <i>B</i><span class="sup">1</span> and <i>C</i><span class="sup">1</span> the same areas
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>as those of the blade sections which they are designed
to balance. The same pressure is maintained in <i>B</i><span class="sup">1</span>
as in <i>B</i>, and in <i>C</i><span class="sup">1</span> as in <i>C</i> by connecting them with
equalizing pipes <i>E E</i>. The third equalizing pipe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>connects the back or right-hand side of the largest dummy
with the exhaust passage so that the same pressure
exists upon it as exists upon the exhaust end of the
rotor. These dummy pistons are shown at the near
end of the rotor in Fig. <a href="#FIG_35">35</a>. They are grooved so as
to form a labyrinth packing, the face of the casing
against which they run being grooved and brass strips
inserted, as shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_39">39</a>. The dummy pistons
prevent leakage from <i>A</i>, <i>B</i><span class="sup">1</span> and <i>C</i><span class="sup">1</span> to the condenser,
and must, of course, run as closely as practicable to
the rings in the casing, the actual clearance being
from about 0.005 to 0.015 of an inch, again depending
on the size of the machine.</p>

<p>The axial adjustment is controlled by the device
shown at <i>T</i> in Fig. <a href="#FIG_34">34</a> and on a larger scale in Fig. <a href="#FIG_40">40</a>.
The thrust bearing consists of two parts, <i>T</i><span class="sub">1</span> <i>T</i><span class="sub">2</span>.
Each consists of a cast-iron body in which are placed brass
collars. These collars fit into grooves <i>C</i>, turned in
the shaft as shown. The halves of the block are
brought into position by means of screws <i>S</i><span class="sub">1</span> <i>S</i><span class="sub">2</span> acting
on levers <i>L</i><span class="sub">1</span> <i>L</i><span class="sub">2</span> and mounted in the bearing pedestal
and cover. The screws are provided with graduated
heads which permit the respective halves of the thrust
bearing to be set within one one-thousandth of an inch.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">
	<a id="FIG_40" name="FIG_40"></a>

		alt="FIG. 40"
		title="FIG. 40"
	/>
	</a><br />
FIG. 40</p>
</div>

<p>The upper screw <i>S</i><span class="sub">2</span> is set so that when the rotor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
exerts a light pressure against it through the thrust
block and lever the grooves in the balance pistons are
just unable to come in contact with the dummy strips
in the cylinder. The lower screw <i>S</i><span class="sub">1</span> is then adjusted
to permit about 0.008 to 0.010 of an inch freedom
for the collar between the grooves of the thrust bearing.</p>

<p>These bearings are carefully adjusted before the
machine leaves the shop, and to prevent either accidental
or unauthorized changes of their adjustment
the adjusting screw heads are locked by the method
shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_40">40</a>. The screw cannot be revolved
without sliding back the latch <i>L</i><span class="sub">3</span>. To do this the pin
<i>P</i><span class="sub">4</span> must be withdrawn, for which purpose the bearing
cover must be removed.</p>

<p>In general this adjustment should not be changed
except when there has been some wear of the collars
in the thrust bearing; nevertheless, it is a wise precaution
to go over the adjustment at intervals. The
method of doing this is as follows: The machine should
have been in operation for some time so as to be well
and evenly heated and should be run at a reduced
speed, say 10 per cent. of the normal, during the actual
operation of making the adjustment. Adjust
the upper screw which, if tightened, would push
the spindle away from the thrust bearing toward the
exhaust. Find a position for this so that when the
other screw is tightened the balance pistons can just
be heard to touch, and so the least change of position
inward of the upper screw will cause the contact to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>cease. To hear if the balance pistons are touching,
a short piece of hardwood should be placed against
the cylinder casing near the balance piston. If the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
ear is applied to the other end of the piece of
wood the contact of the balance pistons can be very
easily detected. The lower screw should then be
loosened and the upper screw advanced from five
to fifteen one-thousandths, according to the machine,
at which position the latter may be considered to be
set. The lower screw should then be advanced until
the under half of the thrust bearing pushes the rotor
against the other half of the thrust bearing, and from
this position it should be pushed back ten or more
one-thousandths, to give freedom for the rotor between
the thrusts, and locked. A certain amount of
care should be exercised in setting the dummies, to
avoid straining the parts and thus obtain a false
setting.</p>

<p>The object in view is to have the grooves of the balance
pistons running as close as possible to the collars
in the cylinder, but without danger of their coming
in actual contact, and to allow as little freedom as
possible in the thrust <ins class="correction" title="original: being">bearing</ins> itself, but enough to be
sure that it will not heat. The turbine rotor itself
has scarcely any end thrust, so that all the thrust
bearing has to do is to maintain the above-prescribed
adjustment.</p>

<p>The blades are so gaged that at all loads the rotor
has a very light but positive thrust toward the running
face of the dummy strips, thus maintaining the proper
clearance at the dummies as determined by the setting
of the proper screw adjustment.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>


<h3>Main Bearings</h3>

<p>The bearings which support the rotor are shown
at <i>F F</i> in Fig. <a href="#FIG_34">34</a> and in detail in Fig. <a href="#FIG_41">41</a>. The bearing
proper consists of a brass tube <i>B</i> with proper oil
grooves. It has a dowel arm <i>L</i> which fits into a corresponding
recess in the bearing cover and which prevents
the bearing from turning. On this tube are
three concentric tubes, <i>C D E</i>, each fitting over the
other with some clearance so that the shaft is free to
move slightly in any direction. These tubes are held
in place by the nut <i>F</i>, and this nut, in turn, is held by
the small set-screw <i>G</i>. The bearing with the surrounding
tubes is placed inside of the cast-iron shell <i>A</i>,
which rests in the bearing pedestal on the block and
liner <i>H</i>. The packing ring <i>M</i> prevents the leakage
of oil past the bearing. Oil enters the chamber at
one end of the bearing at the top and passes through
the oil grooves, lubricating the journal, and then out
into the reservoir under the bearing. The oil also
fills the clearance between the tubes and forms a
cushion, which dampens any tendency to vibration.</p>

	/><br />
FIG. 41</p>
</div>

<p>The bearings, being supported by the blocks or
"pads" <i>H</i>, are self-alining. Under these pads are
liners 5, 10, 20, and 50 thousandths in thickness. By
means of these liners the rotor may be set in its proper
running position relative to the stator. This operation
is quite simple. Remove the liners from under
one bearing pad and place them under the opposite
pad until a blade touch is obtained by turning the
rotor over by hand. After a touch has been obtained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>on the top, bottom, and both sides, the total radial
blade clearance will be known to equal the thickness
of the liners transferred. The position of the rotor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>is then so adjusted that the radial blade clearance is
equalized when the turbine is at operating temperature.</p>

<p>On turbines running at 1800 revolutions per minute
or under, a split babbitted bearing is used, as shown in
Figs. <a href="#FIG_42A">42<i>a</i></a> and <a href="#FIG_42B">42<i>b</i></a>.
These bearings are self-alining and
have the same liner adjustment as the concentric-sleeve
bearings just described. Oil is supplied through
a hole <i>D</i> in the lower liner pad, and is carried to the
oil groove <i>F</i> through the tubes <i>E E</i>. The oil flows
from the middle of this bearing to both ends instead
of from one end to the other, as in the other type.</p>

<h3>Packing Glands</h3>

<p>Where the shaft passes through the casing at either
end it issues from a chamber in which there exists a
vacuum. It is necessary to pack the shaft at these
points, therefore, against the atmospheric pressure,
and this is done by means of a water-gland packing
<i>W W</i> (Fig. <a href="#FIG_34">34</a>). Upon the shaft in Fig. <a href="#FIG_35">35</a>, just in
front of the dummy pistons, will be seen a runner of
this packing gland, which runner is shown upon a
larger scale and from a different direction in Fig. <a href="#FIG_43">43</a>.
To get into the casing the air would have to enter
the guard at <i>A</i> (Fig. <a href="#FIG_44">44</a>), pass over the projecting rings
<i>B</i>, the function of which is to throw off any water
which may be creeping along the shaft by centrifugal
force into the surrounding space <i>C</i>, whence it escapes
by the drip pipe <i>D</i>, hence over the five rings of the
labyrinth packing <i>E</i> and thence over the top of the
revolving blade wheel, it being apparent from Fig. <a href="#FIG_43">43</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>that there is no way for the air to pass by without
going up over the top of the blades; but water is
admitted to the centrally grooved space through the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>pipe shown, and is revolved with the wheel at such
velocity that the pressure due to centrifugal force
exceeds that of the atmosphere, so that it is impossible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>for the air to force the water aside and leak in over
the tips of the blades, while the action of the runner
in throwing the water out would relieve the pressure
at the shafts and avoid the tendency of the water
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to leak outward through the labyrinth packing either
into the vacuum or the atmosphere.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>The water should come to the glands under a head
of about 10 feet, or a pressure of about 5 pounds,
and be connected in such a way that this pressure
may be uninterruptedly maintained. Its temperature
must be lower than the temperature due to the
vacuum within the turbine, or it will evaporate readily
and find its way into the turbine in the form of steam.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">

</div>

<p>In any case a small amount of the steaming water
will pass by the gland collars into the turbine, so that
if the condensed steam is to be returned to the boilers
the water used in the glands must be of such character
that it may be safely used for feed water. But
whether the water so used is to be returned to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>boilers or not it should never contain an excessive
amount of lime or solid matter, as a certain amount
of evaporation is continually going on in the glands
which will result in the deposit of scale and require
frequent taking apart for cleaning.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">

FIG. 46</p>
</div>

<p>When there is an ample supply of good, clean
water the glands may be packed as in Fig. <a href="#FIG_45">45</a>, the
standpipe supplying the necessary head and the supply
valve being opened sufficiently to maintain a small
stream at the overflow. When water is expensive
and the overflow must be avoided, a small float
may be used as in Fig. <a href="#FIG_46">46</a>, the ordinary tank used
by plumbers for closets, etc., serving the purpose
admirably.</p>

<p>When the same water that is supplied to the glands
is used for the oil-cooling coils, which will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>described in detail later, the coils may be attached to
either of the above arrangements as shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_47">47</a>.</p>

<div class="center">

	/><br />
FIG. 47</p>
</div>

<p>When the only available supply of pure water is
that for the boiler feed, and the condensed steam is
pumped directly back to the boiler, as shown in Fig.
<a href="#FIG_48">48</a>, the delivery from the condensed-water pumps
may be carried to an elevation 10 feet above the axis
of the glands, where a tank should be provided of
sufficient capacity that the water may have time to
cool considerably before being used. In most of
these cases, if so desired, the oil-cooling water may
come from the circulating pumps of the condenser,
provided there is sufficient pressure to produce circulation,
as is also shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_48">48</a>.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">
	<a id="FIG_48" name="FIG_48"></a>

	/><br />
FIG. 48</p>
</div>

<p>When the turbine is required to exhaust against a
back pressure of one or two pounds a slightly different
arrangement of piping must be made. The water
in this case must be allowed to circulate through the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>glands in order to keep the temperature below 212
degrees Fahrenheit. If this is not done the water
in the glands will absorb heat from the main castings
of the machine and will evaporate. This evaporation
will make the glands appear as though they were
leaking badly. In reality it is nothing more than
the water in the glands boiling, but it is nevertheless
equally objectionable. This may be overcome by
the arrangement shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_49">49</a>, where two connections
and valves are furnished at <i>M</i> and <i>N</i>, which
drain away to any suitable tank or sewer. These
valves are open just enough to keep sufficient circulation
so that there is no evaporation going on, which
is evidenced by steam coming out as though the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>glands were leaking. These circulating valves may
be used with any of the arrangements above described.</p>

<h3>The Governor</h3>

<p>On the right-hand end of the main shaft in Fig. <a href="#FIG_34">34</a>
there will be seen a worm gear driving the governor.
This is shown on a larger scale at <i>A</i> (Fig. <a href="#FIG_50">50</a>). At
the left of the worm gear is a bevel gear driving the
spindle <i>D</i> of the governor, and at the right an eccentric
which gives a vibratory motion to the lever <i>F</i>.
The crank <i>C</i> upon the end of the shaft operates the
oil pump. The speed of the turbine is controlled by
admitting the steam in puffs of greater or less duration
according to the load. The lever <i>F</i>, having its
fulcrum in the collar surrounding the shaft, operates
with each vibration of the eccentric the pilot valve.
The valve is explained in detail later.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>This form of governor has been superseded by an
improved type, but so many have been made that it
will be well to describe its construction and adjustment.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>The two balls <i>W W</i> (Fig. <a href="#FIG_50">50</a>) are mounted
on the ends of bell cranks <i>N</i>, which rest on knife edges.
The other end of the bell cranks carry rollers upon
which rest a plate <i>P</i>, which serves as a support for
the governor spring <i>S</i>. They are also attached by
links to a yoke and sleeve <i>E</i> which acts as a fulcrum
for the lever <i>F</i>. The governor is regulated by means
of the spring <i>S</i> resting on the plate <i>P</i> and compressed
by a large nut <i>G</i> on the upper end of the governor
spindle, which nut turns on a threaded quill <i>J</i>, held
in place by the nut <i>H</i> on the end of the governor
spindle and is held tight by the lock-nut <i>K</i>. To
change the compression of the spring and thereby the
speed of the turbine the lock-nut must first be loosened
and the hand-nut raised to lower the speed or
lowered to raise the speed as the case may be. This
operation may be accomplished while the machine
is either running or at rest.</p>

<p>The plate <i>P</i> rests upon ball bearings so that by
simply bringing pressure to bear upon the hand-wheel,
which is a part of the quill <i>J</i>, the spring and lock-nut
may be held at rest and adjusted while the rest of
the turbine remains unaffected. Another lever is
mounted upon the yoke <i>E</i> on the pin shown at <i>I</i>, the
other end of which is fastened to the piston of a dash-pot
so as to dampen the governor against vibration.
Under the yoke <i>E</i> will be noticed a small trigger <i>M</i>
which is used to hold the governor in the full-load
position when the turbine is at rest.</p>

<p>The throwing out of the weights elevates the sleeve
<i>E</i>, carrying with it the collar <i>C</i>, which is spanned by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>the lever <i>F</i> upon the shaft <i>H</i>. The later turbines are
provided with an improved form of governor operating
on the same principle, but embodying several important
features. First, the spindle sleeve is integral
with the governor yoke, and the whole rotates about
a vertical stationary spindle, so that two motions are
encountered&mdash;a rotary motion and an up and down
motion, according to the position taken by the governor.
This spiral motion almost entirely eliminates
the effect of friction of rest, and thereby enhances the
sensitiveness of the governor. Second, the governor
weights move outward on a parallel motion opposed
directly by spring thrust, thus relieving the fulcrum
entirely of spring thrust. Third, the lay shaft driving
the governor oil pump and reciprocator is located
underneath the main turbine shaft, so that the rotor
may be readily removed without in the least disturbing
the governor adjustment.</p>


<h3>The Valve-Gear</h3>

<p>The valve-gear is shown in section in Fig. <a href="#FIG_51">51</a>, the
main admission being shown at <i>V</i><span class="sub">1</span> at the right, and
the secondary <i>V</i><span class="sub">2</span> at the left of the steam inlet. The
pilot valve <i>F</i> receives a constant reciprocating motion
from the eccentric upon the layshaft of the turbine
through the lever <i>F</i> (Fig. <a href="#FIG_50">50</a>). These reciprocations
run from 150 to 180 per minute. The space beneath
the piston <i>C</i> is in communication with the large steam
chest, where exists the initial pressure through the
port <i>A</i>; the admission of steam to the piston <i>C</i> being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>controlled by a needle valve <i>B</i>. The pilot valve
connects the port <i>E</i>, leading from the space beneath
the piston to an exhaust port <i>I</i>.</p>

<div class="center">

	</a><br />
FIG. 51</p>
</div>

<p>When the pilot valve is closed, the pressures can
accumulate beneath the piston <i>C</i> and raise the main
admission valve from its seat. When the pilot valve
opens, the pressure beneath the piston is relieved and
it is seated by the helical spring above. If the fulcrum
<i>E</i> (Fig. <a href="#FIG_50">50</a>) of the lever <i>F</i> were fixed the admission
would be of an equal and fixed duration. But
if the governor raises the fulcrum <i>E</i>, the pilot valve
<i>F</i> (Fig. <a href="#FIG_51">51</a>) will be lowered, changing the relations
of the openings with the working edges of the ports.</p>

<p>The seating of the main admission valve is cushioned
by the dashpot, the piston of which is shown
in section at <i>G</i> (Fig. <a href="#FIG_51">51</a>). The valve may be opened
by hand by means of the lever <i>K</i>, to see if it is
perfectly free.</p>

<p>The secondary valve is somewhat different in its
action. Steam is admitted to both sides of its actuating
piston through the needle valves <i>M M</i>, and the
chamber from which this steam is taken is connected
with the under side of the main admission valve, so
that no steam can reach the actuating piston of the
secondary valve until it has passed through the primary
valve. When the pilot valve is closed, the
pressures equalize above and below the piston <i>N</i> and
the valve remains upon its seat. When the load
upon the turbine exceeds its rated capacity, the pilot
valve moves upward so as to connect the space above
the piston with the exhaust <i>L</i>, relieving the pressure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>upon the upper side and allowing the greater pressure
below to force the valve open, which admits steam
to the secondary stage of the turbine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>It would do no good to admit more steam to the
first stage, for at the rated capacity that stage is
taking all the steam for which the blade area will
afford a passage. The port connecting the upper
side of the piston <i>N</i> with the exhaust may be permanently
closed by means of the hand valve <i>Q</i>, to
be found on the side of the secondary pilot valve
chest, thus cutting the secondary valve entirely out
of action. No dashpot is necessary on this valve,
the compression of the steam in the chamber <i>W</i> by
the fall of the piston being sufficient to avoid shock.</p>

<p>The timing of the secondary valve is adjusted by
raising or lowering the pilot valve by means of the
adjustment provided. It should open soon enough
so that there will not be an appreciable drop in speed
before the valve comes into play. The economy of
the machine will be impaired if the valve is allowed
to open too soon.</p>


<h3>Safety Stop Governor</h3>

<p>This device is mounted on the governor end of the turbine
shaft, as shown in Figs. <a href="#FIG_52">52</a> and <a href="#FIG_53">53</a>.
When the speed
reaches a predetermined limit, the plunger <i>A</i>, having
its center of gravity slightly displaced from the center
of rotation of the shaft, is thrown radially outward
and strikes the lever <i>B</i>. It will easily be understood
that when the plunger starts outward, the resistance
of spring <i>C</i> is rapidly overcome, since the centrifugal
force increases as the square of the radius, or in this
case the eccentricity of the center of gravity relative
to the center of rotation. Hence, the lever is struck
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>a sharp blow. This releases the trip <i>E</i> on the outside
of the governor casing, and so opens the steam valve
<i>F</i>, which releases steam from beneath the actuating
piston of a quick-closing throttle valve, located in the
steam line. Thus, within a period of usually less than
one second, the steam is entirely shut off from the
turbine when the speed has exceeded 7 or 8 per cent
of the normal.</p>

<h3>The Oiling System</h3>

<p>Mounted on the end of the bedplate is the oil pump,
operated from the main shaft of the turbine as previously
stated. This may be of the plunger type
shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_54">54</a>, or upon the latest turbine, the
rotary type shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_55">55</a>. Around the bedplate
are located the oil-cooling coils, the oil strainer, the
oil reservoir and the oil pipings to the bearing.</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>The oil reservoir, cooler, and piping are all outside
the machine and easily accessible for cleaning. Usually
a corrugated-steel floor plate covers all this apparatus,
so that it will not be unsightly and accumulate dirt,
particularly when the turbine is installed, so that all
this apparatus is below the floor level; <i>i.e.</i>, when the
top of the bedplate comes flush with the floor line.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>In cases where the turbine is set higher, a casing is
usually built around this material so that it can be easily
removed, and forms a platform alongside the machine.</p>

<p>The oil cooler, shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_56">56</a>, is of the counter-current
type, the water entering at <i>A</i> and leaving at
<i>B</i>, oil entering at <i>C</i> (opening not shown) and leaving
at <i>D</i>. The coils are of seamless drawn copper, and attached
to the cover by coupling the nut. The water
manifold <i>F</i> is divided into compartments by transverse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
ribs, each compartment connecting the inlet of
each coil with the outlet of the preceding coil, thus
placing all coils in series. These coils are removable
in one piece with the coverplate without disturbing
the rest of the oil piping.</p>


<h3>Blading</h3>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">

FIG. 57</p>
</div>

<p>The blades are drawn from a rod consisting of a
steel core coated with copper so intimately connected
with the other metal that when the bar is drawn to
the section required for the blading, the exterior
coating drawn with the rest of the bar forms a
covering of uniform thickness as shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_57">57</a>.
The bar after being drawn through the correct
section is cut into suitable lengths punched as at <i>A</i>
(Fig. <a href="#FIG_58">58</a>), near the top of the blade, and has a groove
shown at <i>B</i> (Fig. <a href="#FIG_59">59</a>), near the root, stamped in
its concave face, while the blade is being cut to length
and punched. The blades are then set into grooves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>cut into the rotor drum or the concave surface of the
casing, and spacing or packing pieces <i>C</i> (Fig. <a href="#FIG_59">59</a>)
placed between them. These spacing pieces are of
soft iron and of the form which is desired that the
passage between the blades shall take. The groove
made upon the inner face of the blade is sufficiently
near to the root to be covered by this spacing piece.
When the groove has been filled the soft-iron pieces
are calked or spread so as to hold the blades firmly
in place. A wire of comma section, as shown at <i>A</i>
(Fig. <a href="#FIG_59">59</a>), is then strung through the punches near
the outer ends of the blades and upset or turned
over as shown at the right in Fig. <a href="#FIG_58">58</a>. This upsetting
is done by a tool which shears the tail of the
comma at the proper width between the blades. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>bent-down portion on either side of the blade holds
it rigidly in position and the portion retained within
the width of the blade would retain the blade in its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>radial position should it become loosened or broken
off at the root. This comma lashing, as it is called,
takes up a small proportion only of the blade length
or projection and makes a job which is surprisingly
stiff and rigid, and yet which yields in case of serious
disturbance rather than to maintain a contact which
would result in its own fusing or the destruction of
some more important member.</p>

<h3>Starting Up the Turbine</h3>

<p>When starting up the turbine for the first time, or
after any extended period of idleness, special care
must be taken to see that everything is in good condition
and that all parts of the machine are clean and
free from injury. The oil piping should be thoroughly
inspected and cleaned out if there is any accumulation
of dirt. The oil reservoirs must be very carefully
wiped out and minutely examined for the presence
of any grit. (Avoid using cotton waste for this, as
a considerable quantity of lint is almost sure to be
left behind and this will clog up the oil passages in
the bearings and strainer.)</p>

<p>The pilot valves should be removed from the barrel
and wiped off, and the barrels themselves cleaned out
by pushing a soft cloth through them with a piece of
wood. In no case should any metal be used.</p>

<p>If the turbine has been in a place where there was
dirt or where there has been much dust blowing around,
the bearings should be removed from the spindle and
taken apart and thoroughly cleaned. With care this
can be done without removing the spindle from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>cylinder, by taking off the bearing covers and very
carefully lifting the weight of the spindle off the bearings,
then sliding back the bearings. It is best to
lift the spindle by means of jacks and a rope sling, as,
if a crane is used, there is great danger of lifting the
spindle too high and thereby straining it or injuring
the blades. After all the parts have been carefully
gone over and cleaned, the oil for the bearing lubrication
should be put into the reservoirs by pouring it
into the governor gear case <i>G</i> (Fig. <a href="#FIG_34">34</a>). Enough oil
should be put in so that when the governor, gear case,
and all the bearing-supply pipes are full, the supply
to the oil pump is well covered.</p>

<p>Special care should be taken so that no grit gets
into the oil when pouring it into the machine. Considerable
trouble may be saved in this respect by
pouring the oil through cloth.</p>

<p>A very careful inspection of the steam piping is
necessary before the turbine is run. If possible it
should be blown out by steam from the boilers before
it is finally connected to the turbine. Considerable
annoyance may result by neglecting this precaution,
from particles of scale, red lead, gasket, etc., out of the
steam pipe, closing up the passages of the guide blades.</p>

<p>When starting up, always begin to revolve the
spindle without vacuum being on the turbine. After
the spindle is turning slowly, bring the vacuum up.
The reason for this is, that when the turbine is standing
still, the glands do not pack and air in considerable
quantity will rush through the glands and down
through the exhaust pipe. This sometimes has the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>effect of unequal cooling. In case the turbine is used
in conjunction with its own separate condenser, the
circulating pump may be started up, then the turbine
revolved, and afterward the air pump put in operation;
then, last, put the turbine up to speed. In
cases, however, where the turbine exhausts into the
same condenser with other machinery and the condenser
is therefore already in operation, the valve
between the turbine and the condenser system should
be kept closed until after the turbine is revolved, the
turbine in the meantime exhausting through the
relief valve to atmosphere.</p>

<p>Care must always be taken to see that the turbine
is properly warmed up before being caused to revolve,
but in cases where high superheat is employed always
revolve the turbine just as soon as it is moderately
hot, and before it has time to become exposed to
superheat.</p>

<p>In the case of highly superheated steam, it is not
undesirable to provide a connection in the steam line
by means of which the turbine may be started up with
saturated steam and the superheat gradually applied
after the shaft has been permitted to revolve.</p>

<p>For warming up, it is usual practice to set the governor
on the trigger (see Fig. <a href="#FIG_50">50</a>) and open the throttle
valve to allow the entrance of a small amount of
steam.</p>

<p>It is always well to let the turbine operate at a reduced
speed for a time, until there is assurance that
the condenser and auxiliaries are in proper working
order, that the oil pump is working properly, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>that there is no sticking in the governor or the valve gear.</p>

<p>After the turbine is up to speed and on the governor,
it is well to count the speed by counting the strokes
of the pump rod, as it is possible that the adjustment
of the governor may have become changed while the
machine has been idle. It is well at this time, while
there is no load on the turbine, to be sure that the
governor controls the machine with the throttle wide
open. It might be that the main poppet valve has
sustained some injury not evident on inspection, or
was leaking badly. Should there be some such defect,
steps should be taken to regrind the valve to its
seat at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>On the larger machines an auxiliary oil pump is
always furnished. This should be used before starting
up, so as to establish the oil circulation before
the turbine is revolved. After the turbine has reached
speed, and the main oil pump is found to be working
properly, it should be possible to take this pump out
of service, and start it again only when the turbine
is about to be shut down.</p>

<p>If possible, the load should be thrown on gradually
to obviate a sudden, heavy demand upon the boiler,
with its sometimes attendant priming and rush of
water into the steam pipe, which is very apt to take
place if the load is thrown on too suddenly. A slug
of water will have the effect of slowing down the
turbine to a considerable extent, causing some annoyance.
There is not likely to be the danger of the damage
that is almost sure to occur in the reciprocating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>engine, but at the same time it is well to avoid this
as much as possible. A slug of water is obviously
more dangerous when superheated steam is being employed,
owing to the extreme temperature changes possible.</p>


<h3>Running</h3>

<p>While the turbine is running, it should have a certain
amount of careful attention. This, of course,
does not mean that the engineer must stand over it
every minute of the day, but he must frequently inspect
such parts as the lubricators, the oiling system,
the water supply to the glands and the oil-cooling
coil, the pilot valve, etc. He must see that the oil
is up in the reservoir and showing in the gage glass
provided for that purpose, and that the oil is flowing
freely through the bearings, by opening the pet cocks
in the top of the bearing covers. An ample supply of
oil should always be in the machine to keep the suction
in the tank covered.</p>

<p>Care must be taken that the pump does not draw
too much air. This can usually be discovered by the
bubbling up of the air in the governor case, when
more oil should be added.</p>

<p>It is well to note from time to time the temperature
of the bearings, but no alarm need be occasioned
because they feel warm to the touch; in fact, a bearing
is all right as long as the hand can be borne upon it
even momentarily. The oil coming from the bearings
should be preferably about 120 degrees Fahrenheit
and never exceed 160 degrees.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>It should generally be seen that the oil-cooling coil
is effective in keeping the oil cool. Sometimes the
cooling water deposits mud on the cooling surface, as
well as the oil depositing a vaseline-like substance,
which interferes with the cooling effect. The bearing
may become unduly heated because of this, when the
coil should be taken out at the first opportunity and
cleaned on the outside and blown out by steam on the
inside, if this latter is possible. If this does not
reduce the temperature, either the oil has been in use
too long without being filtered, or the quality of the
oil is not good.</p>

<p>Should a bearing give trouble, the first symptom
will be burning oil which will smoke and give off dense
white fumes which can be very readily seen and
smelled. However, trouble with the bearings is one
of the most unlikely things to be encountered, and,
if it occurs, it is due to some radical cause, such as
the bearings being pinched by their caps, or grit and
foreign matter being allowed to get into the oil.</p>

<p>If a bearing gets hot, be assured that there is some
very radical cause for it which should be immediately
discovered and removed. Never, under any circumstances,
imagine that you can nurse a bearing, that
has heated, into good behavior. Turbine bearings
are either all right or all wrong. There are no halfway measures.</p>

<p>The oil strainer should also be occasionally taken
apart and thoroughly cleaned, which operation may
be performed, if necessary, while the turbine is in
operation. The screens should be cleaned by being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>removed from their case and thoroughly blown out
with steam. In the case of a new machine, this may
have to be done every two or three hours. In course
of time, this need only be repeated perhaps once a
week. The amount of dirt found will be an indication
of the frequency with which this cleaning is necessary.</p>

<p>The proper water pressure, about five pounds per
square inch, must be maintained at the glands. Any
failure of this will mean that there is some big leak in
the piping, or that the water is not flowing properly.</p>

<p>The pilot valve must be working freely, causing
but little kick on the governor, and should be lubricated
from time to time with good oil.</p>

<p>Should it become necessary, while operating, to
shut down the condenser and change over to non-condensing
operation, particular care should be observed
that the change is not made too suddenly to
non-condensing, as all the low-pressure sections of the
turbine must be raised to a much higher temperature.
While this may not cause an accident, it is
well to avoid the stresses which necessarily result
from the sudden change of temperature. The same
reasons, of course, do not hold good in changing from
non-condensing to condensing.</p>


<h3>Shutting Down</h3>

<p>When shutting down the turbine the load may be
taken off before closing the throttle; or, as in the case
of a generator operating on an independent load, the
throttle may be closed first, allowing the load to act
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>as a brake, bringing the turbine to rest quickly. In
most cases, however, the former method will have
to be used, as the turbine generally will have been
operating in parallel with one or more other generators.
When this is the case, partially close the throttle
just before the load is to be thrown off, and if the turbine
is to run without load for some time, shut off
the steam almost entirely in order to prevent any
chance of the turbine running away. There is no
danger of this unless the main valve has been damaged
by the water when wet steam has been used, or
held open by some foreign substance, when, in either
case, there may be sufficient leakage to run the turbine
above speed, while running light. At the same
time, danger is well guarded against by the automatic
stop valve, but it is always well to avoid a possible
danger. As soon as the throttle is shut, stop
the condenser, or, in the case where one condenser
is used for two or more turbines, close the valve between
the turbine and the condenser. Also open the
drains from the steam strainer, etc. This will considerably
reduce the time the turbine requires to come
to rest. Still more time may be saved by leaving the
field current on the generator.</p>

<p>Care should be taken, when the vacuum falls and
the turbine slows down, to see that the water is shut
off from the glands for fear it may leak out to such an
extent as to let the water into the bearings and impair
the lubricating qualities of the oil.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>


<h3>Inspection</h3>

<p>At regular intervals thorough inspection should be
made of all parts of the turbine. As often as it
appears necessary from the temperature of the oil,
depending on the quality of the oil and the use of the
turbine, remove the oil-cooling coil and clean it both
on the inside and outside as previously directed; also
clean out the chamber in which it is kept. Put in a
fresh supply of oil. This need not necessarily be new,
but may be oil that has been in use before but has
been filtered. We recommend that an oil filter be
kept for this purpose. Entirely new oil need only
be put into the turbine when the old oil shows marked
deterioration. With a first-class oil this will probably
be a very infrequent necessity, as some new oil
has to be put in from time to time to make up the
losses from leakage and waste.</p>

<p>Clean out the oil strainer, blowing steam through
the wire gauze to remove any accumulation of dirt.
Every six months to a year take off the bearing covers,
remove the bearings, and take them apart and clean
out thoroughly. Even the best oil will deposit more
or less solid matter upon hot surfaces in time, which
will tend to prevent the free circulation of the oil
through the bearings and effectively stop the cushioning
effect on the bearings. Take apart the main and
secondary valves and clean thoroughly, seeing that all
parts are in good working order. Clean and inspect
the governor and the valve-gear, wiping out any accumulation
of oil and dirt that may appear. Be sure to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>clean out the drains from the glands so that any water
that may pass out of them will run off freely and will
not get into the bearings.</p>

<p>At the end of the first three months, and after that
about once a year, take off the cylinder cover and
remove the spindle. When the turbine is first started
up, there is very apt to be considerable foreign matter
come over in the steam, such as balls of red lead or
small pieces of gasket too small to be stopped by the
strainer. These get into the guide blades in the cylinder
and quite effectively stop them up. Therefore,
the blades should be gone over very carefully, and
any such additional accumulation removed. Examine
the glands and equilibrium ports for any dirt or
broken parts. Particularly examine the glands for
any deposit of scale. All the scale should be chipped
off the gland parts, as, besides preventing the glands
from properly packing, this accumulation will cause
mechanical contact and perhaps cause vibration of the
machine due to lack of freedom of the parts. The
amount of scale found after the first few inspections
will be an indication of how frequently the cleaning
should be done. As is discussed later, any water
that is unsuitable for boiler feed should not be used
in the glands.</p>

<p>In reassembling the spindle and cover, very great
care must be taken that no blades are damaged and
that nothing gets into the blades. Nearly all the
damage that has been done to blades has resulted
from carelessness in this respect; in fact, it is impossible
to be too careful. Particular care is also to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>taken in assembling all the parts and in handling
them, as slight injury may cause serious trouble. In
no case should a damaged part be put back until the
injury has been repaired.</p>

<p>If for any reason damaged blades cannot be repaired
at the time, they can be easily removed and the
turbine run again without them until it is convenient
to put in new ones; in fact, machines have been run
at full load with only three-quarters of the total number
of blades. In such an event remove the corresponding
stationary blades as well as the moving
blades, so as not to disturb the balance of the end
thrust.</p>


<h3>Conditions Conducive to Successful Operation</h3>

<p>In the operation of the turbine and the conditions
of the steam, both live and exhaust play a very
important part. It has been found by expensive
experimenting that moisture in the steam has a very
decided effect on the economy of operation; or considerably
more so than in the case of the reciprocating
engine. In the latter engine, 2 per cent. of moisture
will mean very close to 2 per cent. increase in the
amount of water supplied to the engine for a given
power. On the other hand, in the turbine 2 per cent.
moisture will cause an addition of more nearly 4 per
cent. It is therefore readily seen that the drier the
entering steam, the better will be the appearance of
the coal bill.</p>

<p>By judicious use of first-class separators in connection
with a suitable draining system, such as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>Holly system which returns the moisture separated
from the steam, back to the boilers, a high degree
of quality may be obtained at the turbine with practically
no extra expense during operation. Frequent
attention should be given the separators and traps
to insure their proper operation. The quality of the
steam may be determined from time to time by the
use of a throttling calorimeter. Dry steam, to a great
extent, depends upon the good and judicious design
of steam piping.</p>

<p>Superheated steam is of great value where it can be
produced economically, as even a slight degree insures
the benefits to be derived from the use of dry
steam. The higher superheats have been found to
increase the economy to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>When superheat of a high degree (100 degrees
Fahrenheit or above) is used special care must be
exercised to prevent a sudden rise of the superheat
of any amount. The greatest source of trouble in
this respect is when a sudden demand is made for a
large increase in the amount of steam used by the engine,
as when the turbine is started up and the superheater
has been in operation for some time before,
the full load is suddenly thrown on. It will be readily
seen that with the turbine running light and the
superheater operating, there is a very small amount
of steam passing through; in fact, practically none,
and this may become very highly heated in the superheater,
but loses nearly all its superheat in passing
slowly to the turbine; then, when a sudden demand
is made, this very high temperature steam is drawn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>into the turbine. This may usually be guarded against
where a separately fired superheater is used, by keeping
the fire low until the load comes on, or, in the case
where the superheater is part of the boiler, by either
not starting up the superheater until after load comes
on, or else keeping the superheat down by mixing
saturated steam with that which has been superheated.
After the plant has been started up there is little
danger from this source, but such precautions should
be taken as seem best in the particular cases.</p>

<p>Taking up the exhaust end of the turbine, we have
a much more striking departure from the conditions
familiar in the reciprocating engine. Due to the
limits imposed upon the volume of the cylinder of
the engine, any increase in the vacuum over 23 or
24 inches, in the case, for instance, of a compound-condensing
engine, has very little, if any, effect on
the economy of the engine. With the turbine, on the
other hand, any increase of vacuum, even up to the
highest limits, increases the economy to a very considerable
extent and, moreover, the higher the vacuum
the greater will be the increase in the economy for a
given addition to the vacuum. Thus, raising the
vacuum from 27 to 28 inches has a greater effect
than from 23 to 24 inches. For this reason the
engineer will readily perceive the great desirability of
maintaining the vacuum at the highest possible point
consistent with the satisfactory and economical operation
of the condenser.</p>

<p>The exhaust pipe should always be carried downward
to the condenser when possible, to keep the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>water from backing up from the condenser into the
turbine. If the condenser must be located above
the turbine, then the pipe should be carried first downward
and then upward in the U form, in the manner
of the familiar "entrainer," which will be found effectively
to prevent water getting back when the turbine
is operating.</p>


<h3>Condensers</h3>

<p>As has been previously pointed out, the successful
and satisfactory operation of the turbine depends
very largely on the condenser. With the reciprocating
engine, if the condenser will give 25 inches
vacuum, it is considered fairly good, and it is allowed
to run along by itself until the vacuum drops to somewhere
below 20 inches, when it is completely gone
over, and in many cases practically rebuilt and the
vacuum brought back to the original 25 inches. It
has been seen that this sort of practice will never do
in the case of the turbine condenser and, unless the
vacuum can be regularly maintained at 27 or 28 inches,
the condenser is not doing as well as it ought to do,
or it is not of the proper type, unless perhaps the
temperature and the quantity of cooling water available
render a higher vacuum unattainable.</p>

<p>On account of the great purity of the condensed
steam from the turbine and its peculiar availability
for boiler feed (there being no oil of any kind mixed
with it to injure the boilers), the surface condenser
is very desirable in connection with the turbine. It
further recommends itself by reason of the high
vacuum obtainable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>Where a condenser system capable of the highest
vacuum is installed, the need of utilizing it to its
utmost capacity can hardly be emphasized too strongly.
A high vacuum will, of course, mean special care and
attention, and continual vigilance for air leaks in the
exhaust piping, which will, however, be fully paid
for by the great increase in economy.</p>

<p>It must not be inferred that a high vacuum is essential
to successful operation of this type of turbine,
for excellent performance both in the matter of steam
consumption and operation is obtained with inferior
vacuum. The choice of a condenser, however, is a
matter of special engineering, and is hardly within the
province of this article.</p>


<h3>Oils</h3>

<p>There are several oils on the market that are suitable
for the purpose of the turbine oiling system, but
great care must be exercised in their selection. In the
first place, the oil must be pure mineral, unadulterated
with either animal or vegetable oils, and must
have been washed free from acid. Certain brands
of oil require the use of sulphuric acid in their manufacture
and are very apt to contain varying degrees
of free acid in the finished product. A sample from
one lot may have almost no acid, while that from
another lot may contain a dangerous amount.</p>

<p>Mineral oils that have been adulterated, when
heated up, will partially decompose, forming acid.
These oils may be very good lubricants when first
put into use, but after awhile they lose all their good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>qualities and become very harmful to the machine
by eating the journals in which they are used. These
oils must be very carefully avoided in the turbine, as
the cheapness of their first cost will in no way pay
for the damage they may do. A very good and simple
way to test for such adulterations is to take up a
quantity of the oil in a test tube with a solution of
borax and water. If there is any animal or vegetable
adulterant present it will appear as a white milk-like
emulsion which will separate out when allowed to
stand. The pure mineral oil will appear at the top
as a clear liquid and the excess of the borax solution
at the bottom, the emulsion being in between. A
number of oils also contains a considerable amount
of paraffin which is deposited in the oil-cooling coil,
preventing the oil from being cooled properly, and in
the pipes and bearings, choking the oil passages and
preventing the proper circulation of the oil and cushioning
effect in the bearing tubes. This is not entirely
a prohibitive drawback, the chief objection being
that it necessitates quite frequently cleaning the
cooling coil, and the oil piping and bearings.</p>

<p>Some high-class mineral oils of high viscosity are
inclined to emulsify with water, which emulsion appears
as a jelly-like substance. It might be added
that high-grade oils having a high viscosity might
not be the most suitable for turbine use.</p>

<p>Since the consumption of oil in a turbine is so very
small, being practically due only to leakage or spilling,
the price paid for it should therefore be of secondary
importance, the prime consideration being its suitability
for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>In some cases a central gravity system will be employed,
instead of the oil system furnished with the
turbine, which, of course, will be a special consideration.</p>

<p>For large installations a central gravity oiling system
has much to recommend it, but as it performs
such an important function in the power plant, and
its failure would be the cause of so much damage,
every detail in connection with it should be most
carefully thought out, and designed with a view that
under no combination of circumstances would it be
possible for the system to become inoperative. One
of the great advantages of such a system is that it
can be designed to contain very large quantities of
oil in the settling tanks; thus the oil will have quite
a long rest between the times of its being used in the
turbine, which seems to be very helpful in extending
the life of the oil. Where the oil can have a long rest
for settling, an inferior grade of oil may be used,
providing, however, that it is absolutely free of acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> condensing arrangements of a turbine are
perhaps mainly instrumental in determining the
method of test. The condensed steam alone, issuing
from a turbine having, for example, a barometric or
jet condenser, cannot be directly measured or weighed,
unless by meter, and these at present are not sufficiently
accurate to warrant their use for test purposes,
if anything more than approximate results are desired.
The steam consumed can, in such a case, only
be arrived at by measuring the amount of condensing
water (which ultimately mingles with the condensed
steam), and subtracting this quantity from the condenser's
total outflow. Consequently, in the case of
turbines equipped with barometric or jet condensers,
it is often thought sufficient to rely upon the measurement
taken of the boiler feed, and the boiler's initial
and final contents. Turbines equipped with surface-condensing
plants offer better facilities for accurate
steam-consumption calculations than those plants in
which the condensed exhaust steam and the circulating
water come into actual contact, it being necessary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>with this type simply to pump the condensed steam
into a weighing or measuring tank.</p>

<p>In the case of a single-flow turbine of the Parsons
type, the covers should be taken off and every row of
blades carefully examined for deposits, mechanical
irregularities, deflection from the true radial and vertical
positions, etc. The blade clearances also should
be gaged all around the circumference, to insure this
clearance being an average working minimum. On no
account should a test be proceeded with when any
doubt exists as to the clearance dimensions.</p>

<p>The dummy rings of a turbine, namely, those rings
which prevent excessive leakage past the balancing
pistons at the high-pressure end, should have especial
attention before a test. A diagrammatic sketch of
a turbine cylinder and spindle is shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_60">60</a>, for
the benefit of those unfamiliar with the subject. In
this <i>A</i> is the cylinder or casing, <i>B</i> the spindle or rotor,
and <i>C</i> the blades. The balancing pistons, <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>, and
<i>F</i>, the pressure upon which counterbalances the axial
thrust upon the three-bladed stages, are grooved, the
brass dummy rings <i>G G</i> in the cylinder being alined
within a few thousandths of an inch of the grooved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>walls, as indicated. After these rings have been
turned (the turning being done after the rings have
been calked in the cylinder), it is necessary to insure
that each ring is perfectly bedded to its respective
grooved wall so that when running the several small
clearances between the groove walls and rings are
equal. A capital method of thus bedding the dummy
rings is to grind them down with a flour of emery or
carborundum, while the turbine spindle is slowly
revolving under steam. Under these conditions the
operation is performed under a high temperature, and
any slight permanent warp the rings may take is thus
accounted for. The turbine thrust-block, which maintains
the spindle in correct position relatively to the
spindle, may also be ground with advantage in a similar manner.</p>

<p>The dummy rings are shown on a large scale in
Fig. <a href="#FIG_61">61</a>, and their preliminary inspection may be made
in the following manner:</p>

<p>The spindle has been set and the dummy rings <i>C</i>
are consequently within a few thousandths of an inch
of the walls <i>d</i> of the spindle dummy grooves <i>D</i>. The
clearances allowed can be gaged by a feeler placed
between a ring and the groove wall. Before a test the
spindle should be turned slowly around, the feelers
being kept in position. By this means any mechanical
flaws or irregularities in the groove walls may be
detected.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">
	<a id="FIG_61" name="FIG_61"></a>
	<img src="images/i115.png"
		alt="FIG. 61"
		title="FIG. 61"
	/><br />
FIG. 61</p>
</div>

<p>It has sometimes been found that the groove walls,
under the combined action of superheated steam and
friction, in cases where actual running contact has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>occurred, have worn very considerably, the wear taking
the form of a rapid crumbling away. It is possible,
however, that such deterioration may be due solely to
the quality of the steel from which the spindle is forged.
Good low-percentage carbon-annealed steel ought to
withstand considerable friction; at all events the wear
under any conditions should be uniform. If the surfaces
of both rings and grooves be found in bad condition,
they should be re-ground, if not sufficiently
worn to warrant skimming up with a tool.</p>

<p>As the question of dummy leakage is of very considerable
importance during a test, it may not be inadvisable
to describe the manner of setting the spindle
and cylinder relatively to one another to insure minimum
leakage, and the methods of noting their conduct
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>during a prolonged run. In Fig. <a href="#FIG_62">62</a>, showing the
spindle, <i>B</i> is the thrust (made in halves), the rings <i>O</i>
of which fit into the grooved thrust-rings <i>C</i> in the
spindle. Two lugs <i>D</i> are cast on each half of the
thrust-block. The inside faces of these lugs are machined,
and in them fit the ball ends of the levers <i>E</i>,
the latter being fulcrumed at <i>F</i> in the thrust-bearing
cover. The screws <i>G</i>, working in bushes, also fit into
the thrust-bearing cover, and are capable of pushing
against the ends of the levers <i>E</i> and thus adjusting the
separate halves of the block in opposite directions.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">
	<a id="FIG_62" name="FIG_62"></a>
	<img src="images/i116.png"
		alt="FIG. 62"
		title="FIG. 62"
	/><br />
FIG. 62</p>
</div>

<p>The top half of the turbine cylinder having been
lifted off, the spindle is set relatively to the bottom
half by means of the lower thrust-block screw <i>G</i>. This
screw is then locked in position and the top half of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>the cover then lowered into place. With this method
great care must necessarily be exercised when lowering
the top cover; otherwise the brass dummy rings may
be damaged.</p>

<p>A safer method is to set the dummy rings in the
center of the grooves of the spindle, and then to lower
the cover, with less possibility of contact. There
being usually plenty of side clearance between the
blades of a turbine, it may be deemed quite safe to
lock the thrust-block in its position, by screwing the
screws <i>G</i> up lightly, and then to turn on steam and
begin running slowly.</p>

<p>Next, the spindle may be very carefully and gradually
worked in the required direction, namely, in that direction
which will tend to bring the dummy rings and
groove walls into contact, until actual but very light
contact takes place. The slightest noise made by the
rubbing parts inside the turbine can be detected by
placing one end of a metal rod onto the casing in
vicinity of the dummy pistons, and letting the other
end press hard against the ear. Contact between the
dummy rings and spindle being thus demonstrated,
the spindle must be moved back by the screws, but
only by the slightest amount possible. The merest
fraction of a turn is enough to break the contact,
which is all that is required. In performing this
operation it is important, during the axial movements
of the spindle, to adjust the halves of the thrust-block
so that there can exist no possible play which would
leave the spindle free to move axially and probably
vibrate badly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>After ascertaining the condition of the dummy rings,
attention might next be turned to the thrust-block,
which must not on any account be tightened up too
much. It is sufficient to say that the actual requirements
are such as will enable a very thin film of oil
to circulate between each wall of the spindle thrust-grooves
and the brass thrust-blocks ring. In other
words, there should be no actual pressure, irrespective
of that exerted by the spindle when running, upon
the thrust-block rings, due to the separate halves
having been nipped too tightly. The results upon a
test of considerable friction between the spindle and
thrust-rings are obvious.</p>

<p>The considerations outlined regarding balancing
pistons and dummy rings can be dispensed with in connection
with impulse turbines of the De Laval and
Rateau types, and also with double-flow turbines of a
type which does not possess any dummies. The same
general considerations respecting blade conditions and
thrust-blocks are applicable, especially to the latter
type. With pure so-called impulse turbines, where
the blade clearances are comparatively large, the preliminary
blade inspection should be devoted to the
mechanical condition of the blade edges and passages.
As the steam velocities of these types are usually
higher, the importance of minimizing the skin friction
and eliminating the possibility of eddies is great.</p>

<p>Although steam leakage through the valves of a
turbine may not materially affect its steam consumption,
unless it be the leakage through the overload
valve during a run on normal full load, a thorough
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>examination of all valves is advocated for many reasons.
In a turbine the main steam-inlet valve is usually
operated automatically from the governor; and whether
it be of the pulsating type, admitting the steam in
blasts, or of the non-pulsating throttling type, it is
equally essential to obtain the least possible friction
between all moving and stationary parts. Similar remarks
apply to the main governor, and any sensitive
transmitting mechanism connecting it with any of the
turbine valves. If a safety or "runaway" governor
is possessed by the machine to be tested, this should
invariably be tried under the requisite conditions before
proceeding farther. The object of this governor
being automatically to shut off all steam from the
turbine, should the latter through any cause rise above
the normal speed, it is often set to operate at about
12 to 15 per cent. above the normal. Thus, a turbine
revolving at about 3000 revolutions per minute would
be closed down at, say, 3500, which would be within
the limit of "safe" speed.</p>


<h3>Importance of Oiling System and Water Service</h3>

<p>The oil question, being important, should be solved
in the early stages previously, if possible, to any official
or unofficial consumption tests. Whether the oil be
supplied to the turbine bearings by a self-contained
system having the oil stored in the turbine bedplate
or by gravity from a separate oil source, does not
affect the question in its present aspect. The necessary
points to investigate are four in number, and may be
headed as follows:</p>

<ol class="parna">
<li>(<i>a</i>) Examination of pipes and partitions for oil
leakage.</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) Determination of volume of oil flowing through
each bearing per unit of time.</li>

<li>(<i>c</i>) Examination for signs of water in oil.</li>

<li>(<i>d</i>) Determination of temperature rise between inlet
and outlet of oil bearings.</li>
</ol>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
The turbine supplied with oil by the gravity or any
other separate system holds an advantage over the
ordinary self-contained machine, inasmuch as the oil
pipes conveying oil into and from the bearings can
be easily approached and, if necessary, repaired. On
the other hand, the machine possessing its own oil
tank, cooling chamber and pump is somewhat at a
disadvantage in this respect, as a part of the system
is necessarily hidden from view, and, further, it is not
easily accessible. The leakage taking place in any
system, if there be any, must, however, be detected and stopped.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#FIG_63">63</a> is given to illustrate a danger peculiar to
the self-contained oil system, in which the oil and
oil-cooling chambers are situated adjacently in the
turbine bedplate. One end of the bedplate only is
shown; <i>B</i> is a cast-iron partition dividing the oil chamber
<i>C</i> from the oil-cooling chamber <i>D</i>. Castings of
this kind have sometimes a tendency to sponginess
and the trouble consequent upon this weakness would
take the form of leakage between the two chambers.
Of course this is only a special case, and the conditions
named are hardly likely to exist in every similarly
designed plant. The capacity of oil, and especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>of hot oil, to percolate through the most minute pores
is well known. Consequently, in advocating extreme
caution when dealing with oil leakage, no apology is
needed.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">
	<a id="FIG_63" name="FIG_63"></a>
	<img src="images/i121.png"
		alt="FIG. 63"
		title="FIG. 63"
	/><br />
FIG. 63</p>
</div>

<p>It may be stated without fear of contradiction that
the oil in a self-contained system, namely, a system
in which the oil, stored in a reservoir near or underneath
the turbine, passes only through that one turbine's
bearings, and immediately back to the storage
compartment, deteriorates more rapidly than when
circulating around an "entire" system, such as the
gravity or other analogous system. In the latter, the
oil tanks are usually placed a considerable distance
from the turbine or turbines, with the oil-cooling
arrangements in fairly close proximity. The total
length of the oil circuit is thus considerably increased,
incidentally increasing the relative cooling capacity of
the whole plant, and thereby reducing the loss of oil
by vaporization.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>The amount of oil passing through the bearings can
be ascertained accurately by measurement. With a
system such as the gravity it is only necessary to run
the turbine up to speed, turn on the oil, and then, over
a period, calculate the volume of oil used by measuring
the fall of level in the storage tank and multiplying
by its known cross-sectional area. In those cases
where the return oil, after passing through the bearings,
is delivered back into the same tank from which
it is extracted, it is of course necessary, during the
period of test, to divert this return into a separate
temporary receptacle. Where the system possesses
two tanks, one delivery and one return (a superior
arrangement), this additional work is unnecessary.
The same method can be applied to individual turbines
pumping their own oil from a tank in the bedplate;
the return oil, as previously described, being temporarily
prevented from running back to the supply.</p>

<p>The causes of excessive oil consumption by bearings
are many. There is an economical mean velocity at
which the oil must flow along the revolving spindle;
also an economical mean pressure, the latter diminishing
from the center of the bearing toward the ends.
The aim of the economist must therefore be in the
direction of adjusting these quantities correctly in
relation to a minimum supply of oil per bearing; and
the principal factors capable of variation to attain
certain requirements are the several bearing clearances
measured as annular orifices, and the bearing diameters.</p>

<p>It is not always an easy matter to detect the presence
of water in an oil system, and this difficulty is increased
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>in large circuits, as the water, when the oil is not flowing,
generally filters to the lowest members and pipes
of the system, where it cannot usually be seen. A considerable
quantity of water in any system, however,
indicates its presence by small globular deposits on
bearings and spindles, and in the worst cases the water
can clearly be seen in a small sample tapped from the
oil mains. There is only one effective method of
ridding the oil of this water, and this is by allowing the
whole mass of oil in the system to remain quiescent
for a few days, after which the water, which falls to
the lowest parts, can be drained off. A simple method
of clearing out the system is to pump all the oil the
whole circuit contains through the filters, and thence
to a tank from which all water can be taken off.
One of the ordinary supply tanks used in the gravity
system will serve this purpose, should a temporary
tank not be at hand. If necessary, the headers and
auxiliary pipes of the system can be cleaned out before
circulating the oil again, but as this is rather a large
undertaking, it need only be resorted to in serious cases.</p>

<p>It is seldom possible to discover the correct and
permanent temperature rise of the circulating oil in a
turbine within the limited time usually alloted for a
test. After a continuous run of one hundred hours
it is possible that the temperature at the bearing outlets
may be lower than it was after the machine had
run for, say, only twenty hours. As a matter of fact
an oil-temperature curve plotted from periodical readings
taken over a continuous run of considerable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>length usually reaches a maximum early, afterward
falling to a temperature about which the fluctuations
are only slight during the remainder of the run. Fig. <a href="#FIG_64">64</a>
illustrates an oil-temperature curve plotted from
readings taken over a period of twenty-four hours.
In this case the oil system was of the gravity description,
the capacity of the turbine being about 6000
kilowatts. The bearings were of the ordinary white-metal
spherical type. Over extended runs of hundreds
and even thousands of hours, the above deductions
may be scarcely applicable. Running without break
for so long, a small turbine circulating its own lubricant
would possibly require a renewal of the oil before the
run was completed, in the main owing to excessive
temperature rise and consequent deterioration of the
quality of the oil. Under these conditions the probabilities
are that several temperature fluctuations might
occur before the final maximum, and more or less
constant, temperature was reached. In this connection,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>however, the results obtained are to a very large
extent determined by the general mechanical design
and construction of the oiling system and turbine. A
reference to Fig. <a href="#FIG_63">63</a> again reveals at once a weakness
in that design, namely, the unnecessarily close proximity
in which the oil and water tanks are placed.</p>

<p>A design of thermometer cup suitable for oil thermometers
is given in Fig. <a href="#FIG_65">65</a> in which <i>A</i> is an end view
of the turbine bedplate, <i>B</i> is a turbine bearing and <i>C</i>
and <i>D</i> are the inlet and outlet pipes, respectively.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>The thermometer fittings, which are placed as near the
bearing as is practicable, are made in the form of an
angular tee fitting, the oil pipes being screwed into
its ends. The construction of the oil cup and tee
piece is shown in the detail at the left where <i>A</i> is the
steel tee piece, into which is screwed the brass thermometer
cup <i>B</i>. The hollow bottom portion of this
cup is less than 1/16 of an inch in thickness. The top
portion of the bored hole is enlarged as shown, and into
this, around the thermometer, is placed a non-conducting
material. The cup itself is generally filled
with a thin oil of good conductance.</p>

<p>Allied to the oil system of a turbine plant is the water
service, of comparatively little importance in connection
with single self-contained units of small capacity,
where the entire service simply consists of a few coils
and pipes, but of the first consideration in large installations
having numerous separate units supplied
by oil and water from an exterior source. The largest
turbine units are often supplied with water for cooling
the bearings and other parts liable to attain high temperature.
Although the water used for cooling the
bearings indirectly supplements the action taking
place in the separate oil coolers, it is of necessity a
separate auxiliary service in itself, and the complexity
of the system is thus added to. A carefully constructed
water service, however, is hardly likely to give trouble
of a mechanical nature. The more serious deficiencies
usually arise from conditions inherent to the design,
and as such must be approached.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>


<h3>Special Turbine Features to be Inquired into</h3>

<p>Before leaving the prime mover itself, and proceeding
to the auxiliary plant inspection, it may be well to
instance a few special features relating to the general
conduct of a turbine, which it is the duty of a tester
to inquire into. There are certain specified qualifications
which a machine must hold when running under
its commercial conditions, among these being lack of
vibration of both turbine and machinery driven, be it
generator or fan, the satisfactory running of auxiliary
turbine parts directly driven from the turbine spindle,
minimum friction between the driving mediums, such
as worm-wheels, pumps, fans, etc., slight irregularities
of construction, often resulting in heated parts and
excessive friction and wear, and must therefore be
detected and righted before the final test. Furthermore,
those features of design&mdash;and they are not infrequent
in many machines of recent development&mdash;which,
in practice, do not fulfil theoretical expectations,
must be re-designed upon lines of practical consistency.
The experienced tester's opinion is often at this point
invaluable. To illustrate the foregoing,
Figs. <a href="#FIG_66">66</a>, <a href="#FIG_67">67</a>, and <a href="#FIG_68">68</a>
are given, representing, respectively, three
distinct phases in the evolution of a turbine part,
namely, the coupling. Briefly, an ordinary coupling
connecting a driving and a driven shaft becomes
obstinate when the two separate spindles which it
connects are not truly alined. The desire of turbine
manufacturers has consequently been to design a
flexible coupling, capable of accommodating a certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
want of alinement between the two spindles without
in any way affecting the smooth running of the whole unit.</p>

	/><br />
Fig. <a href="#FIG_67">67</a></p>
</div>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#FIG_66">66</a> <i>A</i> is the turbine spindle end and <i>B</i> the
generator spindle end, which it is required to drive.
It will be seen from the cross-sectional end view that
both spindle ends are squared, the coupling <i>C</i>, with a
square hole running through it, fitting accurately over
both spindle ends as shown. Obviously the fit between
the coupling and spindle in this case must be
close, otherwise considerable wear would take place;
and equally obvious is the fact than any want of
alinement between the two spindles <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> will be
accompanied by a severe strain upon the coupling, and
incidentally by many other troubles of operation of
which this inability of the coupling to accommodate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>itself to a little want of alinement is the inherent cause.</p>

<p>Looking at the coupling illustrated in Fig. <a href="#FIG_67">67</a>, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>will be seen that something here is much better adapted
to dealing with troubles of alinement. The turbine
and generator spindles <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, respectively, are
coned at the ends, and upon these tapered portions are
shrunk circular heads <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> having teeth upon their
outer circumferences. Made in halves, and fitting
over the heads, is a sleeve-piece, with teeth cut into
its inner bored face. The teeth of the heads and sleeve
are proportioned correctly to withstand, without
strain, the greatest pressure liable to be thrown upon
them. There is practically no play between the teeth,
but there exists a small annular clearance between
the periphery of the heads and the inside bore of the
sleeve, which allows a slight lack of alinement to exist
between the two spindles, without any strain whatever
being felt by the coupling sleeve <i>E</i>. The nuts
<i>F</i> and <i>G</i> prevent any lateral movement of the coupling
heads <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>. For all practical requirements this
type of coupling is satisfactory, as the clearances
allowed between sliding sleeve and coupling heads
can always be made sufficient to accommodate a considerable
want of alinement, far beyond anything
which is likely to occur in actual practice. Perhaps
the only feature against it is its lack of simplicity of
construction and corresponding costliness.</p>

FIG. 68</p>
</div>

<p>The type illustrated in Fig. <a href="#FIG_68">68</a> is a distinct advance
upon either of the two previous examples, because,
theoretically at least, it is capable of successfully
accommodating almost any amount of spindle movement.
The turbine and generator spindle ends, <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i>, have toothed heads <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> shrunk upon them,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>the heads being secured by the nuts <i>E</i> and <i>F</i>. The
teeth in this case are cut in the enlarged ends as shown.
A sleeve <i>G</i>, made in halves, fits over the heads, and
the teeth cut in each half engage with those of their
respective heads. All the teeth and teeth faces are
cut radially, and a little side play is allowed.</p>


<h3>The Condenser</h3>

<p>To some extent, as previously remarked, the condenser
and condensing arrangements are instrumental
in determining the lines upon which a test ought to be
carried out. In general, the local features of a plant
restrict the tester more or less in the application of his
general methods. A thorough inspection, including
some preliminary tests if necessary, is as essential to
the good conduct of the condensing plant as to the
turbine above it. It may be interesting to outline
the usual course this inspection takes, and to draw
attention to a few of the special features of different
plants. For this purpose a type of vertical condenser
is depicted in Fig. <a href="#FIG_69">69</a>. Its general principle will be
gathered from the following description:</p>

<p>Exhaust steam from the turbine flows down the pipe
<i>T</i> and enters the condenser at the top as shown, where
it at once comes into contact with the water tubes in
<i>W</i>. These tubes fill an annular area, the central un-tubed
portion below the baffle cap <i>B</i> forming the vapor
chamber. The condensed steam falls upon the bottom
tube-plate <i>P</i> and is carried away by the pipe <i>S</i> leading
to the water pump <i>H</i>. The Y pipe <i>E</i> terminating
above the level of the water in the condenser
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>enters the dry-air pump section pipe <i>A</i>. Cold circulating
water enters the condenser at the bottom,
through the pipe <i>I</i>, and entering the water chamber <i>X</i>
proceeds upward through the tubes into the top-water
chamber <i>Y</i>, and from there out of the condenser
through the exit pipe. It will be observed that the
vapor extracted through the plate <i>P</i> passes on its journey
out of the condenser through the cooling chamber
<i>D</i> surrounded by the cold circulating water. This, of
course, is a very advantageous feature. At <i>R</i> is the
condenser relief, at <i>U</i> the relief valve for the water chambers.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">
	<a id="FIG_69" name="FIG_69"></a>

	/><br />
FIG. 69</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>A new condenser, especially if it embody new and
untried features, generally requires a little time and
patience ere the best results can be obtained from it.
Perhaps the quickest and most satisfactory method of
getting at the weak points of this portion of a plant is
to test the various elements individually before applying
a strict load test. Thus, in dealing with a condenser
similar to that illustrated in Fig. <a href="#FIG_69">69</a>, the careful tester
would probably make, in addition to a thorough mechanical
examination, three or four individual vacuum
and water tests. A brief description of these will be
given. The water test, the purpose of which is to
discover any leakage from the tubes, tube-plates,
water pipes, etc., into portions of the steam or air
chambers, should be made first.</p>


<h3>Water Tests of Condenser</h3>

<p>The condenser is first thoroughly dried out, particular
care being given to the outside of the tubes
and the bottom tube-plate <i>P</i>. Water is then circulated
through the tubes and chambers for an hour or
two, after which the pumps are stopped, all water is
allowed to drain out and a careful examination is
made inside. Any water leaking from the tubes above
the bottom baffle-plate will ultimately be deposited
upon that plate. It is essential to stop this leakage
if there be any, otherwise the condensed steam measured
during the consumption test will be increased to
the extent of the leakage. A slight leakage in a large
condenser will obviously not affect the results to any
serious extent. The safest course to adopt when a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>leak is discovered and it is found inopportune to effect
immediate repair is to measure the actual volume of
leakage over a specified period, and the quantity then
being known it can be subtracted from the volume of
the condensed steam at the end of the consumption test.</p>

<p>It is equally essential that no leakage shall occur
between the bottom tube-plate <i>P</i> and the tube ends.
The soundness of the tube joints, and the joint at the
periphery of the tube-plate can be tested by well covering
the plate with water, the water chamber <i>W</i> and
cooling chamber having been previously emptied, and
observing the under side of the plate. It must be
admitted that the practice of measuring the extent of
a water leak over a period, and afterward with this
knowledge adjusting the obtained quantities, is not
always satisfactory. On no account should any test
be made with considerable water leakage inside the
condenser. The above method, however, is perhaps
the most reliable to be followed, if during its conduct
the conditions of temperature in the condenser are
made as near to the normal test temperature as possible.
There are many condensers using salt water in
their tubes, and in these cases it would seem natural
to turn to some analytical method of detecting the
amount of saline and foreign matter leaking into the
condensed steam. Unless, however, only approximate
results are required, such methods are not advocated.
There are many reasons why they cannot be relied
upon for accurate results, among these being the variation
in the percentage of saline matter in the sea-water,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>the varying temperature of the condenser tubes
through which the water flows, and the uncertainty
of such analysis, especially where the percentage
leakage of pure saline matter is comparatively small.</p>


<h3>The Vacuum Test</h3>

<p>Having convinced himself of the satisfactory conduct
of the condenser under the foregoing simple
preparatory water tests, the tester may safely pass
to considerations of vacuum. There exists a good
old-fashioned method of discovering the points of
leakage in a vacuum chamber, namely, that of applying
the flame of a candle to all seams and other vulnerable
spots, which in the location of big leaks is
extremely valuable. Assuming that the turbine joints
and glands have been found capable of preventing any
inleak of air, with only a small absolute pressure of
steam or air inside it, and, further, an extremely important
condition, with the turbine casing at high and
low temperatures, separately, a vacuum test can be
conducted on the condenser alone.</p>

<p>This test consists of three operations. In the first
place a high vacuum is obtained by means of the air
pump, upon the attainment of which communication
with everything else is closed, and results noted. The
second operation consists in repeating the above with
the water circulating through the condenser tubes, the
results in this case also being carefully tabulated. Before
conducting the third test, the condensers must be
thoroughly warmed throughout, by running the turbine
for a short time if necessary, and after closing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>communication with everything, allowing the vacuum to
slowly fall.</p>

<p>A careful consideration and comparison of the foregoing
tests will reveal the capabilities of the condenser
in the aspect in which it is being considered, and will
suggest where necessary the desirable steps to be taken.</p>

<h3>Special Auxiliary Plant for Consumption Test</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are one or two points of importance in the
conduct of a test on a turbine and these will be briefly
touched upon. Fig. <a href="#FIG_70">70</a> illustrates the general arrangement
of the special auxiliary plant necessary for
carrying through a consumption test, when the turbine
exhaust passes through a surface condenser.
The condensed steam, after leaving the condenser,
passes along the pipe <i>A</i> to the pump, and is then forced
along the pipe <i>B</i> (leading under ordinary circumstances
to the hot-well), through the main water
valve <i>C</i> directly to the measuring tanks. To enter
these the water has to pass through the valves <i>D</i> and
<i>E</i>, while the valves <i>F</i> and <i>G</i> are for quickly emptying
the tanks when necessary, being of a larger bore than
the inlet valves. The inlet pipes <i>H</i> <i>I</i> are placed directly
above the outlet valves, and thus, when required,
before any measurements are taken, the
water can flow directly through the outlet valves,
the pipes terminating only a short distance above
them, away to an auxiliary tank or directly to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>hot-well. Levers <i>K</i> and <i>L</i> fulcrumed at <i>J</i> and <i>J</i> are
connected to the valve spindles by auxiliary levers.
The valve arrangement is such that by pulling down
the lever <i>K</i> the inlet valve <i>D</i> is opened and the inlet
valve <i>E</i> is closed. Again, by pulling down the lever
<i>L</i> the outlet valve <i>F</i> is closed, while the outlet valve
<i>G</i> is also simultaneously closed.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">
	<a id="FIG_70" name="FIG_70"></a>
	<img src="images/i138.png"
		alt="FIG. 70"
		title="FIG. 70"
	/><br />
FIG. 70</p>
</div>

<p>During a consumption test the valves are operated
in the following manner: The lever <i>K</i> is pulled down,
which opens the inlet valve to the first tank and closes
that to the second. The bottom lever <i>L</i>, however, is
lifted, which for the time being opens the outlet valve
<i>F</i>, and incidentally opens the valve <i>G</i>; the latter
valve can; however, for the moment be neglected.
When the turbine is started, and the condensed steam
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>begins to accumulate in the condenser, the water is
pumped along the pipes and, both the inlet and outlet
valves on the first tank being open, passes through,
without any being deposited in the tank, to the drain.
This may be continued until all conditions are right
for a consumption test and, the time being carefully
noted, lever <i>L</i> is quickly pulled down and the valves
<i>F</i> and <i>G</i> closed. The first tank now gradually fills,
and after a definite period, say fifteen minutes, the
lever <i>K</i> is pushed up, thus diverting the flow into the
second tank. While the latter is filling, the water in
the first tank is measured, and the tank emptied by
a large sluice valve, not shown.</p>

<p>The operation of alternately filling, measuring, and
emptying the two measuring tanks is thus carried
on until the predetermined time of duration of test
has expired, when the total water as measured in the
tanks, and representing the amount of steam condensed
during that time, is easily found by adding
together the quantities given at each individual
measurement.</p>

<p>All that are necessary to insure successful results
from a plant similar to this are care and accuracy in
its operation and construction. Undoubtedly in
most cases it is preferable to weigh the condensed
steam instead of measuring the volume passed, and
from that to calculate the weight. If dependence is
being placed upon the volumetric method, it is advisable
to lengthen the duration of the test considerably,
and if possible to measure the feed-water evaporated
at the same time. Such a course, however, would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>necessitate little change, and none of a radical nature,
from the arrangement described. Where, however,
the measuring method is adopted, the all-important
feature, requiring on the tester's part careful personal
investigation, is the graduation of the tanks.
It facilitates this operation very considerably when
the receptacles are graduated upon a weight scale.
That is to say, whether or not a vertical scale showing
the actual hight of water be placed inside the tank,
it is advisable to have a separate scale indicating at
once to the attendant the actual contents, by weight,
of the tank at any time. It is the tester's duty to
himself to check the graduation of this latter scale
by weighing the water with which he performs the
operation of checking.</p>

<p>Apart from the foregoing, there is little to be said
about the measuring apparatus. As has been stated,
accuracy of result depends in this connection, as in
all others, upon careful supervision and sound and
accurate construction, and this the tester can only
positively insure by exhaustive inspection in the one
case and careful deliberation in the conduct of the other.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that the procedure&mdash;and
this implies some limitations&mdash;of a test is to an
extent controlled by the conditions, or particular environment
of the moment. This is strictly true, and
as a consequence it is often impossible, in a maker's
works, for example, to obtain every condition, coinciding
with those specified, which are to be had on
the site of final operation only. For this reason it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>would appear best to reserve the final and crucial
test of a machine, which test usually in the operating
sense restricts a prime mover in certain directions
with regard to its auxiliary plant, etc., until the machine
has been finally erected on its site. Obviously,
unless a machine had become more or less standardized,
a preliminary consumption test would be necessary,
but once this primary qualification respecting
consumption had been satisfactorily settled, there
appears to be no reason why exhaustive tests in other
directions should not all be carried out upon the site,
where the conditions for them are so much more favorable.</p>

<p>When the steam consumption of a steam turbine
is so much higher than the guaranteed quantity, it
usually takes little less than a reconstruction to put
things right. The minor qualifications of a machine,
however, which can be examined into and tested with
greater ease, and usually at considerably less expense,
upon the site, and consequently under specified conditions,
may be advantageously left over until that
site is reached, where it is obvious that any shortcomings
and general deficiency in performance will be
more quickly detected and diagnosed.</p>


<h3>Test Loads from the Tester's View-point</h3>

<p>Before proceeding to describe the points of actual
interest in the consumption test, a few considerations
respecting test loads will be dealt with from the tester's
point of view. Here again we often find ourselves
restricted, to an extent, by the surrounding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>conditions. The very first considerations, when undertaking
to carry out a consumption test, should be
devoted to obtaining the steadiest possible
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber: load?">lead</ins>. It
may be, and is in many cases, that circumstances
are such as to allow a steady electrical load to be
obtained at almost any time. On the other hand an
electrical load of any description is sometimes not
procurable at all, without the installation of a special
plant for the purpose. In such cases a mechanical
friction load, as, for example, that obtained by the
water brake, is sometimes available, or can easily be
procured. Whereas, however, this type of load may
be satisfactory for small machines, it is usually quite
impossible for use with large units, of, say, 5000 kilowatts
and upward. It is seldom, however, that
turbines are made in large sizes for directly driving
anything but electrical plants, although there is every
possibility of direct mechanical driving between large
steam turbines and plants of various descriptions,
shortly coming into vogue, so that usually there exist
some facilities for obtaining an electrical load at both
the maker's works and upon the site of operation.</p>

<p>One consideration of importance is worth inquiring
into, and this has relation to the largest turbo-generators
supplied for power-station and like purposes.
Obviously, the testing of, say, a 7000-kilowatt alternator
by any standard electrical-testing method must
entail considerable expense, if such a test is to be
carried out in the maker's works. Nor would this
expense be materially decreased by transferring the
operations to the power-station, and there erecting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>the necessary electrical plant for obtaining a water
load, or any other installation of sufficient capacity
to carry the required load according to the rated full
capacity of the machine.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, that there exist no permanent
facilities at either end, namely the maker's works
and the power station, for adequately procuring a
steady electrical-testing load of sufficient capacity,
there still remains, in this instance, an alternative
source of power which is usually sufficiently elastic
to serve all purposes, and this is of course the total
variable load procurable from the station bus-bars.
It is conceivable that one out of a number of machines
running in parallel might carry a perfectly steady
load, the latter being a fraction of a total varying
quantity, leaving the remaining machines to receive
and deal with all fluctuations which might occur.
Even in the event of there being only two machines,
it is possible to maintain the load on one of them
comparatively steady, though the percentage variation
in load on either side of the normal would in the
latter case be greater than in the previous one. This
is accomplished by governor regulation after the
machines have been paralleled. For example, assuming
three turbo-alternators of similar make and capacity
to be running in parallel, each machine carrying
exactly one-third of the total distributed load, it is
fair to regard the governor condition, allowing for
slight mechanical disparities of construction, of all
three machines as being similar; and even in the case
of three machines of different capacity and construction,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>the governor conditions when the machines are
paralleled are more or less relatively and permanently
fixed in relation to one another. In other words,
while the variation in load on each machine is the
same, the relative variation in the governor condition
must be constant.</p>

<p>By a previously mentioned system of governor
regulation, however, it is possible, considering again
for a moment the case of three machines in parallel,
by decreasing the sensitiveness of one governor only,
to accommodate nearly all the total variation in load
by means of the two remaining machines, the unresponsiveness
of the one governor to change in speed
maintaining the load on that machine fairly constant.
By this method, at any rate, the variation in load on
any one machine can be minimized down to, say, 3
per cent, either side of the normal full load.</p>

<p>There is another and more positive method by
which a perfectly steady load can be maintained upon
one machine of several running in parallel. This
may be carried out as follows: Suppose, in a station
having a total capacity of 20,000 kilowatts, there are
three machines, two of 6000 kilowatts each, and one
of 8000 kilowatts, and it is desired to carry out a
steady full-load test upon one of the 6000 kilowatts
units. Assuming that the test is to be of six hours'
duration, and that the conditions of load fluctuations
upon the station are well known, the first step to take
is to select a period for the test during which the total
load upon all machines is not likely to fall below, say,
8000 kilowatts. The tension upon the governor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>spring of the turbine to be tested must then be adjusted
so that the machine on each peak load is taxed
to its utmost normal capacity; and even when the
station load falls to its minimum, the load from the
particular machine shall not be released sufficiently
to allow it to fall below 6000 kilowatts. Under these
conditions, then, it may be assumed that although
the load on the test machine will vary, it cannot fall
below 6000 kilowatts. Therefore, all that remains
to be done to insure a perfectly steady load equal to
the normal full load of the machine, or 6000 kilowatts,
is to fix the main throttle or governing valve in such
a position that the steam passing through at constant
pressure is just capable of sustaining full speed under
the load required. When this method is adopted,
it is desirable to fix a simple hight-adjusting and locking
mechanism to the governing-valve spindle. The
load as read on the indicating wattmeter can then
be very accurately varied until correct, and farther
varied, if necessary, should any change occur in the
general conditions which might either directly or indirectly
bring about a change of load.</p>


<h3>Preparing the Turbine for Testing</h3>

<p>All preliminary labors connected with a test being
satisfactorily disposed of, it only remains to place the
turbines under the required conditions, and to then
proceed with the test. For the benefit of those inexperienced
in the operation of large turbines, we will
assume that such a machine is about to be started
for the purpose outlined.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>It is always advisable to make a strict practice of
getting all the auxiliary plant under way before starting
up the turbine. In handling a turbine plant the
several operations might be carried through in the
following order:</p>

<ol class="parnn">
<li>(1) Circulating oil through all bearings and oil chambers.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></li>

<li>(2) Starting of condenser circulating-water pumps,
and continuous circulation of circulating water through
the tubes of condenser.</li>

<li>(3) Starting of pump delivering condensed steam
from the condenser hot-well to weighing tanks.</li>

<li>(4) Starting of air pump, vacuum being raised as
high as possible within condenser.</li>

<li>(5) Sealing of turbine glands, whether of liquid or
steam type, no adjustment of the quantity of sealing
fluid being necessary, however, at this point.</li>

<li>(6) Adjustment of valves on and leading to the
water-weighing tanks.</li>

<li>(7) Opening of main exhaust valve or valves between
turbine and condenser.</li>

<li>(8) Starting up of turbine and slowly running to
speed.</li>

<li>(9) Application of load, and adjustment of gland-sealing steam.</li>
</ol>


<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> In a self-contained system, where the oil pump is usually
driven from the turbine spindle, this would of course be impossible. In
the gravity and allied systems, however, it should always be the first
operation performed. The tests for oil consumption, described
previously, having been carried out, it is assumed that suitable means
have been adopted to restrict the total oil flow through the bearings to
a minimum quantity.</p></div>

<p>The running to speed of large turbo-alternators
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>requires considerable care, and should always be
done slowly; that is to say the rate of acceleration
should be slow. It is well known that the vibration
of a heavy unit is accompanied by a synchronous or
non-synchronous vibration of the foundation upon
which it rests. The nearest approach to perfect
synchronism between unit and foundation is obtained
by a gradual rise in speed. A machine run up to
speed too quickly might, after passing the critical
speed, settle down with little visible vibration, but at
a later time, even hours after, suddenly begin vibrating
violently from no apparent cause. The chances
of this occurring are minimized by slow and careful
running to speed.</p>

<p>Whether the machine being tested is one of a number
running in parallel, or a single unit running on a
steady water load, the latter should in all cases be
thrown on gradually until full load is reached. A
preliminary run of two or three hours&mdash;whenever
possible&mdash;should then be made, during which ample
opportunity is afforded for regulating the conditions
in accordance with test requirements. The tester
will do well during the last hour of this trial run to
station his recorders at their several posts and, for
a short time at least, to have a complete set of readings
taken at the correct test intervals. This more
particularly applies to the electrical water, superheat
and vacuum readings. In the case of a turbo-alternator
the steadiness obtainable in the electrical load
may determine the frequency of readings taken, both
electrical and otherwise. On a perfectly steady water-tank
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>load, for example, it may be sufficiently adequate
to read all wattmeters, voltmeters, and ammeters
from standard instruments at from one- to two-minute
intervals. Readings at half-minute intervals, however,
should be taken with a varying load, even when
the variation is only slight.</p>

<p>The water-measurement readings may of course be
taken at any suitable intervals, the time being to an
extent determined by the size of the measuring tanks
or the capacity of the weighing machine or machines.
When designing the measuring apparatus, the object
should be to minimize, within economical and practical
range, the total number of weighings or measurements
necessary. Consequently, no strict time of
interval between individual weighings or measurements
can be given in this case. It may be said, however,
that it is not desirable to take these at anything
less than five-minute intervals. Under ordinary circumstances
a three- to five-minute interval is sufficient
in the case of all steam-pressure, vacuum&mdash;including
mercurial columns and barometer&mdash;superheat and
temperature readings.</p>


<h3>Gland and Hot-Well Regulation</h3>

<p>There are two highly important features requiring
more or less constant attention throughout a test,
namely the gland and hot-well regulation. For the
present purpose we may assume that the glands are
supplied with either steam or water for sealing them.
All steam supplied to the turbine obviously goes to
swell the hot-well contents, and to thus increase the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>total steam consumption. The ordinary steam gland
is in reality a pressure gland. At both ends of the
turbine casing is an annular chamber, surrounding
the turbine spindle at the point where it projects
through the casing. A number of brass rings on either
side of this chamber encircle the spindle, with only a
very fine running clearance between the latter and
themselves. Steam enters the gland chamber at a
slight pressure, and, when a vacuum exists inside the
turbine casing, tends to flow inward. The pressure,
however, inside the gland is increased until it exceeds
that of the atmosphere outside, and by maintaining
it at this pressure it is obvious that no air can possibly
enter the turbine through the glands, to destroy
the vacuum. The above principle must be borne in
mind during a test upon a turbine having steam-fed
glands. Perhaps the best course to follow&mdash;in view
of the economy of gland steam consumption necessary&mdash;is
as follows:</p>

<p>During the preliminary non-test run, full steam is
turned into both glands while the vacuum is being
raised, and maintained until full load has been on
the turbine for some little time. The vacuum will by
this time have probably reached its maximum, and
perhaps fallen to a point slightly lower, at which hight
it may be expected to remain, other conditions also
remaining constant. The gland steam must now be
gradually turned off until the amount of steam vapor
issuing from the glands is almost imperceptible.
This should not lower the vacuum in the slightest
degree. By gradual degrees the gland steam can be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>still farther cut down, until no steam vapor at all
can be discerned issuing from the gland boxes. This
reduction should be continued until a point is reached
at which the vacuum is affected, when it must be
stopped and the amount of steam flowing to the gland
again increased very slightly, just enough to bring
the vacuum again to its original hight. The steam
now passing into the glands is the minimum required
under the conditions, and should be maintained
as nearly constant as possible throughout the
test. Practically all steam entering the glands is
drawn into the turbine, and thence to the condenser,
and under the circumstances it may be assumed the
increase in steam consumption arising from this source
is also a minimum.</p>

<p>There is one mechanical feature which has an important
bearing upon the foregoing question, and
which it is one of the tester's duties to investigate.
This is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#FIG_71">71</a>, which shows a turbine
spindle projecting through the casing. The gland
box is let into the casing as shown. Brass rings <i>A</i>
calked into the gland box encircle the shaft on either
side of the annular steam space <i>S</i>. As the clearance
between the turbine spindle and the rings <i>A</i> is in a
measure instrumental in determining the amount of
steam required to maintain a required pressure inside
the chamber, it is obvious that this clearance should
be minimum. An unnecessarily large clearance means
a proportionally large increase in gland steam consumption
and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>When the turbine glands are sealed with water, all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>water leakage which takes place into the turbine, and
ultimately to the condenser hot-well, must be measured
and subtracted from the hot-well contents at the end of a test.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks would not apply to those
cases in which the gland supply is drawn from and
returned to the hot-well, or a pipe leading from the
hot-well. Then no correction would be necessary,
as all water used for gland purposes might be assumed
as being taken from the measuring tanks and returned
again in time for same or next weighing or measurement.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>


<h3>General Considerations</h3>

<p>There are a few principal elementary points which
it is necessary always to keep in mind during the
conduct of a test. Among these are the effects of
variation in vacuum, superheat, initial steam pressure,
and, as already indicated, in load. There exist
many rules for determining the corrections necessitated
by this variation. For example, it is often
assumed that 9 degrees Fahrenheit, excess or otherwise,
above or below that specified, represents an increase
or reduction in efficiency of about 1 per cent.
It is probable that the percentage increase or decrease
in steam consumption, in the case of superheat, can
be more reliably calculated than in other cases, as,
for example, vacuum; but the increase cannot be said
to be due solely to the variation in superheat. In
other words, the individuality of the particular turbine
being tested always contributes something, however
small this something may be, to the results obtained.</p>

<p>These remarks are particularly applicable where
vacuum is concerned. Here again rules exist, one of
these being that every additional inch of vacuum
increases the economy of the turbine by something
slightly under half a pound of steam per kilowatt-hour.
But a moment's consideration convinces one
of the utter unreliability of such rules for general
application. It is, for instance, well known that
many machines, when under test, have demonstrated
that the total increase in the water rate is very far
from constant. A machine tested, for example, gave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>approximately the following results, the object of the
test being to discover the total increase in the water
rate per inch decrease in vacuum:</p>

<p>From 27 inches to 26 inches, 4.5 per cent.</p>

<p>From 26.2 inches to 24.5 inches, 2.5 per cent.</p>

<p>This illustrates to what an extent the ratio of increase
can vary, and it must be borne in mind that it is very
probable that the variation is different in different
types and sizes of machines.</p>

<p>There can exist, therefore, no empirical rules of a
reliable nature upon which the tester can base his
deductions. The only way calculated to give satisfaction
is to conduct a series of preliminary tests upon
the turbine undergoing observation, and from these
to deduce all information of the nature required,
which can be permanently recorded in a set of curves
for reference during the final official tests.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it must be admitted that many published
tests outlining the performances of certain
makes of turbine are unreliable. To determine
honestly the capabilities of any machine in the direction
of steam economy is an operation requiring time,
and unbiased and accurate supervision. By means
of such assets as "floating quantities," short tests
during exceptionally favorable conditions, and disregard
of the vital necessity of running a test under
the proper specified conditions, it is comparatively
easy to obtain results apparently highly satisfactory,
but which under other conditions might be just
the reverse. These considerations are, however, unworthy
of the tester proper.</p>

<h3>The Jet Condenser</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> jet condenser illustrated in Fig. <a href="#FIG_72">72</a> is singularly
well adapted for the turbine installation. As the
type has not been so widely adopted as the more
common forms of jet condenser and the surface types,
it may prove of interest to describe briefly its general
construction and a few of its special features in relation
to tests.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">

FIG. 72</p>
</div>

<p>Referring to the figure, <i>C</i> is the main condenser
body. Exhaust steam enters at the left-hand side
through the pipe <i>E</i>, condensing water issuing through
the pipe <i>D</i> at the opposite side. Passing through the
short conical pipe <i>P</i>, the condensing water enters
the cylindrical chamber <i>W</i> and falls directly upon
the spraying cone <i>S</i>. The hight of this spraying cone
is determined by the tension upon the spring <i>T</i>, below
the piston <i>R</i>, the latter being connected to the cone
by a spindle <i>L</i>. An increase of the water pressure
inside the chamber <i>W</i> will thus compress the spring,
and the spraying cone being consequently lowered
increases the aperture between it and the sloping
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>lower wall of the chamber <i>W</i>, allowing a greater volume
of water to be sprayed. The piston <i>R</i> incidentally
prevents water entering the top vapor chamber
<i>V</i>. From the foregoing it can be seen that this condenser
is of the contra-flow type, the entering steam
coming immediately into contact with the sprayed
water. The perforated diaphragm plate <i>F</i> allows
the vapor to rise into the chamber <i>V</i>, from which it
is drawn through the pipe <i>A</i> to the air pump. A
relief valve <i>U</i> prevents an excessive accumulation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>of pressure in the vapor chamber, this valve being
obviously of delicate construction, capable of opening
upon a very slight increase of the internal pressure
over that of the atmosphere. Condensed steam and
circulating water are together carried down the pipe
<i>B</i> to the well <i>Z</i>, from which a portion may be carried
off as feed water, and the remainder cooled and passed
through the condenser again. Under any circumstances,
whether the air pump is working or not, a
certain percentage of the vapor in the condenser is
always carried down the pipe <i>B</i>, and this action alone
creates a partial vacuum, thus rendering the work of
the air pump easier. As a matter of fact, a fairly high
vacuum can be maintained with the air pump closed
down, and only the indirect pumping action of the
falling water operating to rarify the contents of the
condenser body. It is customary to place the condenser
forty or more feet above the circulating-water
pump, the latter usually being a few feet below the turbine.</p>


<h3>Features Demanding Attention</h3>

<p>When operating a condenser of this type, the most
important features requiring preliminary inspection
and regulation while running are:</p>

<ol class="parna">
<li>(<i>a</i>) Circulating-water regulation.</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) Freedom of all mechanical parts of spraying mechanism.</li>

<li>(<i>c</i>) Relief-valve regulation.</li>

<li>(<i>d</i>) Water-cooling arrangements.</li>
</ol>


<p>The tester will, however, devote his attention to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>a practical survey of the condenser and its auxiliaries,
before running operations commence.</p>

<p>A preliminary vacuum test ought to be conducted
upon the condenser body, and the exhaust piping
between the condenser and turbine. To accomplish
this the circulating-water pipe <i>D</i> can be filled with
water to the condenser level. The relief valve should
also be water-sealed. Any existing leakage can thus
be located and stopped.</p>

<p>Having made the condenser as tight as possible
within practical limits, vacuum might be again raised
and, with the same parts sealed, allowed to fall slowly
for, say, ten minutes. A similar test over an equal
period may then be conducted with the relief valve
not water-sealed. A comparison of the times taken
for an equal fall of vacuum in inches, under the different
conditions, during the above two tests, will reveal
the extent of the leakage taking place through the
relief valve. It seems superfluous to add that the
fall of vacuum in both the foregoing tests must not
be accelerated in any way, but must be a result simply
of the slight inevitable leakage which is to be found in
every system.</p>

<p>On a comparatively steady load, and with consequently
only small fluctuation in the volume of steam
to be condensed, the conditions are most favorable
for regulating the amount of circulating water necessary.
Naturally, an excess of water above the required
minimum will not affect the pressure conditions
inside the condenser. It does, however, increase
the quantity of water to be handled from the hot-well,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>and incidentally lowers the temperature there,
which, whether the feed-water pass through economizers
or otherwise, is not advisable from an economical
standpoint. Thus there is an economical
minimum of circulating water to be aimed at, and,
as previously stated, it can best be arrived at by running
the turbine under normal load and adjusting
the flow of the circulating water by regulating the
main valve and the tension upon the spring <i>T</i>. Under
abnormal conditions, the breakdown of an air pump,
or the sudden springing of a bad leak, for instance,
the amount of circulating water can be increased by
a farther opening of the main valve if necessary, and
a relaxation of the spring tension by hand; or, the
spring tension might be automatically changed immediately
upon the vacuum falling.</p>

<p>The absolute freedom of all moving parts of the
spraying mechanism should be one of the tester's
first assurances. To facilitate this, it is customary
to construct the parts, with the exception of the springs,
of brass or some other non-corrosive metal. The
spraying cone must be thoroughly clean in every
channel, to insure a well-distributed stream of water.
Nor is it less important that careful attention be
given to the setting and operation of the relief valve,
as will be seen later. The obvious object of such a
valve is to prevent the internal condenser pressure
ever being maintained much higher than the atmospheric
pressure. A number of carefully designed
rubber flap valves, or one large one, have been found
to act successfully for this purpose, although a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>balanced valve of more substantial construction would
appear to be more desirable.</p>


<h3>Importance of Relief Valves</h3>

<p>The question of relief valves in turbine installations
is an important one, and it seems desirable at this
point to draw attention to another necessary relief
valve and its function, namely the turbine atmospheric
valve. As generally understood, this is placed
between the turbine and condenser, and, should the
pressure in the latter, owing to any cause, rise above
that of the atmosphere, it opens automatically and
allows the exhaust steam to flow through it into the
atmosphere, or into another condenser.</p>

<p>A general diagrammatic arrangement of a steam
turbine, condenser, and exhaust piping is shown in
<ins class="correction" title="original: Fig. 2">Fig. <a href="#FIG_73">73</a></ins>.
Connected to the exhaust pipe <i>B</i>, near to the
condenser, is the automatic atmospheric valve <i>D</i>,
from which leads the exhaust piping <i>E</i> to the atmosphere.
The turbine relief valve is shown at <i>F</i>, and
the condenser relief valve at <i>G</i>. The main exhaust
valve between turbine and condenser is seen at <i>H</i>.
We have here three separate relief valves: one, <i>F</i>, to
prevent excessive pressure in the turbine: the second,
<i>D</i>, an atmospheric valve opening a path to the air,
and, in addition to preventing excessive pressure
accumulating, also helping to keep the temperature
of the condenser body and tubes low; the third, the
condenser relief valve <i>G</i>, which in itself ought to be
capable of exhausting all steam from the turbine,
should occasion demand it.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">
	<a id="FIG_73" name="FIG_73"></a>

FIG. 73</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>Assuming a plant of this description to be operating
favorably, the conditions would of necessity be
as follows: The valves <i>F</i>, <i>D</i>, and <i>G</i>, all closed; the
valve <i>H</i> open. Suppose that, owing to sudden loss
of circulating water, the vacuum fell to zero. The
condenser would at once fill with steam, a slight pressure
would be set up, and whichever of the three valves
happened to be set to blow off at the lowest pressure
would do so. Now it is desirable that the first valve
to open under such circumstances should be the atmospheric
valve <i>D</i>. This being so, the condenser
would remain full of steam at atmospheric pressure
until the attendant had had time to close the main
hand-or motor-operated exhaust valve <i>H</i>, which he
would naturally do before attempting to regain the
circulation of the condensing water. Again, assume
the installation to be running under the initial conditions,
with the atmospheric valve <i>D</i> and all remaining
valves except <i>H</i> closed.</p>

<p>Suppose the vacuum again fell to zero from a
similar cause, and, further, suppose the atmospheric
valve <i>D</i> failed to operate automatically. The only
valves now capable of passing the exhaust steam are
the turbine and condenser relief valves <i>F</i> and <i>G</i>.
Inasmuch as the pressures at exhaust in the turbine
proper, on varying load, vary over a considerably
greater range than the small fairly constant absolute
pressures inside the condenser, it is obviously necessary
to allow for this factor in the respective setting
of these two relief valves. In other words, the obvious
deduction is to set the turbine relief valve to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>blow off at a higher pressure than the condenser relief
valve, even when considering the question with respect
to condensing conditions only. In this second
hypothetical case, then, with a closed and disabled
atmospheric valve, the exhaust must take place
through the condenser, until the turbine can be shut
down, or the circulating water regained without the
former course being found necessary.</p>

<p>There is one other remote case which may be
assumed, namely, the simultaneous refusal of both
atmospheric and condenser relief valves to open, upon
the vacuum inside the condenser being entirely lost.
The exhaust would then be blown through the turbine
relief valve <i>F</i>, until the plant could be closed down.</p>

<p>Although the conditions just cited are highly improbable
in actual practice, it can at once be seen that
to insure the safety of the condenser, absolutely, the
turbine relief valve must be set to open at a comparatively
low pressure, say 40 pounds by gage, or thereabouts.
To set it much lower than this would create
a possibility of its leaking when the turbine was making
a non-condensing run, and when the pressure at the
turbine exhaust end is often above that of the atmosphere.
From every point of view, therefore, it is
advisable to make a minute examination of all relief
valves in a system, and before a test to insure that
these valves are all set to open at their correct relative pressures.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the practice of placing a
large relief valve upon a condenser in addition to the
atmospheric exhausting valve is by no means common.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>The latter valve, where surface condensing is adopted,
is often thought sufficient, working in conjunction
with a quickly operated main exhaust valve. Similarly,
with a barometric condenser as that illustrated
in Fig. <a href="#FIG_72">72</a>, the atmospheric exhaust valve <i>D</i> (seen in
Fig. <a href="#FIG_73">73</a>) is sometimes dispensed with. This course
is, however, objectionable, for upon a loss of vacuum
in the turbine, all exhaust steam must pass through
the condenser body, or the entire plant be closed down
until the vacuum is regained. The simple construction
of the barometric condenser, however, is in such
an event much to its advantage, and the passage of
the hot steam right through it is not likely to seriously
warp or strain any of its parts, as might probably
happen in the case of a surface condenser.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>The question of the advisability of thus adding
to a plant can only be fairly decided when all conditions,
operating and otherwise, are fully known.
For example, if we assume a large turbine to be operating
on a greatly varying load, and exhausting into
a condenser, as that in Fig. <a href="#FIG_72">72</a>, and, further, having
an adequate stand-by to back it up, one's obvious
recommendation would be to equip the installation
with both a condenser relief valve and an atmospheric
valve, in addition, of course, to the main
exhaust valve, which is always placed between the
atmospheric valve and condenser. There are still
other considerations, such as water supply, condition
of circulating water, style of pump, etc., which must
all necessarily have an obvious bearing upon the
settlement of this question; so that generalization is
somewhat out of place, the final design in all cases
depending solely upon general principles and local conditions.</p>


<h3>Other Necessary Features of a Test</h3>

<p>In connection with the condenser, of any type, and
its auxiliaries, there remain a few necessary examinations
and operations to be conducted, if it is desired
to obtain the very best results during the test. It
will be sufficient to just outline them, the method of
procedure being well known, and the requirement
of any strict routine being unnecessary. These include:</p>

<ol class="parnn">
<li>(1) A thorough examination of the air-pump, and,
if possible, an equally careful examination of
diagrams<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
taken from it when running on full load. Also
careful examination of the piping, and of any other
connections between the air pump and condenser, or
other auxiliaries. It will be well in this examination
to note the general "lay" of the air pipes, length,
hight to which they rise above condenser and air
pump, facilities for drainage, etc., as this information
may prove valuable in determining the course necessary
to rectify deficiencies which may later be found
to exist.</li>

<li>(2) In a surface condenser, inspection of the pumps
delivering condensed steam to the measuring tanks
or hot-well; inspection of piping between the condenser
and the pump, and also between the pump and
measuring tanks. If these pumps are of the centrifugal
type it is essential to insure, for the purposes
of a steam-consumption test, as much regularity of
delivery as possible.</li>

<li>(3) In the case of a consumption test upon a turbine
exhausting into a barometric condenser, and
where the steam consumed is being measured by the
evaporation in the boiler over the test period, time
must be devoted to the feed-pipes between the feed-water
measuring meter or tank and the boilers. Under
conditions similar to those operating in a plant such
as that shown in Fig. <a href="#FIG_72">72</a>, the necessary boiler feed
might be drawn from the hot-well, the remainder of
the hot-well contents probably being pumped through
water coolers, or towers, for circulating through the
condenser. With the very best system, it is possible
for a slight quantity of oil to leak into the exhaust
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
steam, and thence to the hot-well. In its passage,
say along wooden conduits, to the measuring tank or
meter, this water would probably pass through a number
of filters. The efficiency of these must be thoroughly
insured. It is unusual, in those cases where
a simple turbine steam-consumption test is being
carried out, and not an efficiency test of a complete
plant, to pass the measured feed-water through economizers.
Should the latter course, owing to special
conditions, become necessary, a careful examination
of all economizer pipes would be necessary.</li>

<li>(4) The very careful examination of all thermometer
pockets, steam- and temperature-gage holes, etc.,
as to cleanliness, non-accumulation of scale, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Special Auxiliaries Necessary</h3>

<p>Having outlined the points of interest and importance
in connection with the more permanent features
of a plant, we arrive at the preparation and fitting of
those special auxiliaries necessary to carry on the test.</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p>It is customary, when carrying out a first test, upon
both prime mover and auxiliaries, to place every important
stage in the expansion in communication with
a gage, so that the various pressures may be recorded
and later compared with the figures of actual requirement.
To do this, in the case of the turbine, it is
necessary to bore holes in the cover leading to the
various expansion chambers, and into each of these
holes to screw a short length of steam pipe, having
preferably a loop in its length, to the other end of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>which the gage is attached. Fig. <a href="#FIG_74">74</a> illustrates, diagrammatically,
a complete turbine installation, and
shows the various points along the course taken by
the steam at which it is desirable to place pressure
gages. The figure does not show the high-pressure
steam pipe, nor any of the turbine valves. With
regard to these, it will be desirable to place a steam
gage in the pipe, immediately before the main stop-valve,
and another immediately after it. Any fall
of pressure between the two sides of the valve can thus
be detected. To illustrate this clearly, Fig. <a href="#FIG_75">75</a> is
given, showing the valves of a turbine, and the position
of the gages connected to them. The two gages
<i>E</i> and <i>F</i> on either side of the main stop-valve <i>A</i> are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>also shown. The steam after passing through the
valve, which, in the case of small turbines, is hand-operated,
goes in turn through the automatic stop-valve
<i>B</i>, the function of which is to automatically
shut steam off should the turbine attain a predetermined
speed above the normal, the steam strainer <i>C</i>,
and finally through the governing valve <i>D</i> into the
turbine. As shown, gages <i>G</i> and <i>H</i> are also fitted
on either side of the strainer, and these, in conjunction
with gages <i>E</i> and <i>F</i>, will enable any fall in pressure
between the first two valves and the governing valve
to be found. Up to the governing-valve inlet no
throttling of the steam ought to take place under
normal conditions, <i>i.e.</i>, with all valves open, and
consequently any fall in pressure between the steam
inlet and this point must be the result of internal
wire-drawing. By placing the gages as shown, the
extent to which this wire-drawing affects the pressures
obtainable can be discovered.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="caption">
	<a id="FIG_75" name="FIG_75"></a>
	<img src="images/i167.png"
		alt="FIG. 75"
		title="FIG. 75"
	/><br />
FIG. 75</p>
</div>

<p>On varying and even on normal and steady full
load, the steam is more or less reduced in pressure
after passing through the governing valve <i>D</i>; a gage <i>I</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>must consequently be placed between the valve,
preferably on the valve itself, and the turbine. Returning
to Fig. <a href="#FIG_74">74</a>, the gages shown are <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>,
and <i>E</i>, connected to the first, second, third, fourth,
and fifth expansions; also <i>F</i> in the turbine and exhaust
space, where there are no blades, <i>G</i> in the exhaust
pipe immediately before the main exhaust valve <i>E</i>
(see Fig. <a href="#FIG_73">73</a>), and <i>H</i> connected to the condenser. On
condensing full load it is probable that <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>
will all register pressures above the atmosphere, while
gages <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>, and <i>G</i> will register pressures below
the atmosphere, being for this purpose vacuum gages.
On the other hand, with a varying load, and consequently
varying initial pressures, one or two of the
gages may register pressure at one moment and vacuum
at another. It will therefore be necessary to
place at these points compound gages capable of
registering both pressure and vacuum. With the
pressures in the various stages constantly varying,
however, a gage is not by any means the most reliable
instrument for recording such variations. The constant
swinging of the finger not only renders accurate
reading at any particular moment both difficult and,
to an extent, unreliable, but, in addition, the accompanying
sudden changes of condition, both of temperature
and pressure, occurring inside the gage tube,
in a comparatively short time permanently warp this
part, and thus altogether destroy the accuracy of
the gage. It is well known that even with the best
steel-tube gages, registering comparatively steady
pressures, this warping of the tube inevitably takes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>place. The quicker deterioration of such gage tubes,
when the gage is registering quickly changing pressures,
can therefore readily be conceived, and for
this reason alone it is desirable to have all gages,
whatever the conditions under which they work,
carefully tested and adjusted at short intervals. If
it is desired to obtain reliable registration of the several
pressures in the different expansions of a turbine
running on a varying load, it would therefore seem
advisable to obtain these by some type of external
spring gage (an ordinary indicator has been found to
serve well for this purpose) which the sudden internal
variations in pressure and temperature cannot deleteriously affect.</p>

<p>In view of the great importance he must attach to
his gage readings, the tester would do well to test
and calibrate and adjust where necessary all the
gages he intends using during a test. This he can do
with a standard gage-testing outfit. By this means
only can he have full confidence in the accuracy of his results.</p>

<p>In like manner it is his duty personally to supervise
the connecting and arrangement of the gages,
and the preliminary testing for leakage which can
be carried out simultaneously with the vacuum test
made upon the turbine casing.</p>


<h3>Where Thermometers are Required</h3>

<p>Equally important with the foregoing is the necessity
of calibrating and testing of all thermometers
used during a test. Where possible it is advisable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>to place new thermometers which have been previously
tested at all points of high temperature. Briefly
running them over, the points at which it is necessary
to place thermometers in the entire system of the
steam and condensing plant are as follows:</p>

<ol class="parnn">
<li>(1) A thermometer in the steam pipe on the boiler,
where the pipe leaves the superheater.</li>

<li>(2) In the steam pipe immediately in front of the
main stop-valve, near point <i>E</i> in Fig. <a href="#FIG_75">75</a>.</li>

<li>(3) In the main governing valve body (see <i>I</i>, Fig. <a href="#FIG_75">75</a>)
on the inlet side.</li>

<li>(4) In the main governing valve body on the turbine
side, which will register temperatures of steam
after it has passed through the valve.</li>

<li>(5) In the steam-turbine high-pressure chamber,
giving the temperature of the steam before it has
passed through any blades.</li>

<li>(6) In the exhaust chamber, giving the temperature
of steam on leaving the last row of blades.</li>

<li>(7) In the exhaust pipe near the condenser.</li>

<li>(8) In the condenser body.</li>

<li>(9) In the circulating-water inlet pipe close to the condenser.</li>

<li>(10) In the circulating-water outlet pipe close to the condenser.</li>

<li>(11) In the air-pump suction pipe close to the condenser.</li>

<li>(12) In the air-pump suction pipe close to the air pump.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is not advisable to place at those vital points,
the readings at which directly or indirectly affect the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>consumption, two thermometers, say one ordinary
chemical thermometer and one thermometer of the
gage type, thus eliminating the possibility of any
doubt which might exist were only one thermometer placed there.</p>

<p>There is no apparent reason why one should attempt
to take a series of temperature readings during a
consumption test on varying load. The temperatures
registered under a steady load test can be obtained
with great reliability, but on a varying load,
with constantly changing temperatures at all points,
this is impossible. This is, of course, owing to the
natural sluggishness of the temperature-recording
instruments, of whatever class they belong to, in
responding to changes of condition. As a matter of
fact, the possibility of obtaining correctly the entire
conditions in a system running under greatly varying
loads is very doubtful indeed, and consequently great
reliance cannot be placed upon figures obtained under
such conditions.</p>

<p>A few simple calculations will reveal to the tester
his special requirements in the direction of measuring
tanks, piping, etc., for his steam consumption test.
Thus, assuming the turbine to be tested to be of 3000
kilowatt capacity normal load, with a guaranteed
steam consumption of, say, 14.5 pounds per kilowatt-hour,
he calculates the total water rate per hour,
which in this case would be 43,500 pounds, and designs
his weighing or measuring tanks to cope with that
amount, allowing, of course, a marginal tank volume
for overload requirements.</p>

VIII. TROUBLES WITH STEAM TURBINE AUXILIARIES<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
</h2>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Contributed to <i>Power</i> by Walter B. Gump.</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> case about to be described concerns a steam
plant in which there were seven cross-compound
condensing Corliss engines, and two Curtis steam
turbines. The latter were each of 1500-kilowatt
capacity, and were connected to surface condensers,
dry-vacuum pumps, centrifugal, hot-well and circulating
pumps, respectively. In the illustration (Fig. <a href="#FIG_76">76</a>),
the original lay-out of piping is shown in full lines.
Being originally a reciprocating plant it was difficult
to make the allotted space for the turbines suitable
for their proper installation. The trouble which
followed was a perfectly natural result of the failure
to meet the requirements of a turbine plant, and the
description herein given is but one example of a great
many where the executive head of a concern insists
upon controlling the situation without regard to engineering
advice or common sense.</p>

</div>

<h3>Circulating Pump Fails to Meet Guarantee</h3>

<p>Observing the plan view, it will be seen that the
condensers for both turbines receive their supply of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
cooling water from the same supply pipe; that is, the
pipes, both suction and discharge, leading to No. 1
condenser are simply branches from No. 2, which was
installed first without consideration for a second unit.
When No. 1 was installed there was a row of columns
from the basement floor to the main floor extending
in a plane which came directly in front of the condenser.
The column <i>P</i> shown in the plan was so located
as to prevent a direct connection between the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>centrifugal circulating pump and the condenser
inlet. The centrifugal pump was direct-connected
to a vertical high-speed engine, and the coupling is
shown at <i>E</i> in the elevation.</p>

<p>Every possible plan was contemplated to accommodate
the engine and pump without removing any
of the columns, and the arrangement shown was
finally adopted, leaving the column <i>P</i> in its former
place by employing an S-connection from the pump
to the condenser. It should be stated that the pump
was purchased under a guarantee to deliver 6000 gallons
per minute under a head of 50 feet, with an impeller
velocity of 285 revolutions per minute. The
vertical engine to which the pump was connected
proved to be utterly unfit for running at a speed beyond
225 to 230 revolutions per minute, and in addition
the S-bend would obviously reduce the capacity,
even at the proper speed of the impeller.</p>

<p>Besides these factors there was another feature
even more serious. It was found that when No. 2
unit was operating No. 1 could not get as great a
quantity of circulating water as when No. 2 was shut
down. This was because No. 2 was drawing most
of the water, and No. 1 received only that which No. 2
could not pull from the suction pipe <i>A</i>. This will
be clear from the fact that the suction and discharge
pipes for No. 1 were only 16 inches, while those of
No. 2 were 20 inches and 16 inches, respectively. The
condenser for No. 2 had 1000 square feet less cooling
surface than No. 1, which had 6000 square feet and
was supplied with cooling water by means of two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>centrifugal pumps of smaller capacity than for No. 1
and arranged in parallel. These were each driven by
an electric motor, and were termed "The Siamese
Twins," due to the way in which they were connected.</p>

<p>The load factor of the plant ranged from 0.22 to
0.30, the load being almost entirely lighting, so that
for the winter season the load factor reached the
latter figure. The day load was, therefore, light and
not sufficient to give one turbine more than from
one-fourth to one-third its rated capacity. Under
these conditions No. 1 unit was able to operate much
more satisfactorily than when fully loaded, because
of the fact that the cooling water was more effective.
This was, of course, all used by No. 1 unit when No. 2
was not operating. At best, however, it was found
that the vacuum could not be made to exceed 24
inches, and during the peak, with the two turbines
running, the vacuum would often drop to 12 inches.
A vacuum of 16 inches or 18 inches on the peak was
considered good.</p>


<h3>An Investigation</h3>

<p>Severe criticism "rained" heavily upon the engineer
in charge, and complaints were made in reference
to the high oil consumption. An investigation on
the company's part followed, and the firm which
furnished the centrifugal pump and engine was next
in order to receive complaints. Repeated efforts were
made to increase the speed of the vertical engine to
285 revolutions per minute, but such a speed proved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>detrimental to the engine, and a lower speed of about
225 revolutions per minute had to be adopted.</p>

<p>A thorough test on the pump to ascertain its delivery
at various speeds was the next move, and a notched
weir, such as is shown in the elevation, was employed.
The test was made on No. 2 cooling tower, not shown
in the sketch, and showed that barely 3000 gallons
per minute were being delivered to the cooling tower.
While the firm furnishing the pump was willing to
concede that the pump might not be doing all it should,
attention was called to the fact that there might be
some other conditions in connection with the system
which were responsible for the losses. Notable
among these was the hydraulic friction, and when this
feature of the case was presented, the company did
not seem at all anxious to investigate the matter further;
obviously on account of facing a possible necessity
for new piping or other apparatus which might cost something.</p>

<p>Approximately 34 feet was the static head of water
to be pumped over No. 2 cooling tower. Pressure
gages were connected to the suction, discharge, and
condenser inlet, as shown at <i>G</i>, <i>G'</i> and <i>G''</i> respectively.
When No. 1 unit was operating alone the gage <i>G</i>
showed practically zero, indicating no vacuum in
the suction pipe. Observing the same gage when
No. 2 unit was running, a vacuum as high as 2 pounds
was indicated, showing that No. 2 was drawing more
than its share of cooling water from the main <i>A</i> and
hence the circulating pump for No. 1 was fighting for
all it received. Gage <i>G'</i> indicated a pressure of 21
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>pounds, while <i>G''</i> indicated 18.5 pounds, showing a
difference of 2.5 pounds pressure lost in the S-bend.
This is equivalent to a loss of head of nearly 6 feet,
0.43 pound per foot head being the constant employed.
The total head against which the pump worked was therefore</p>

<div style="position:relative;width:100%">
<p class="center"><i>G'</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>G</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;21&nbsp;+&nbsp;2,</p>

<span style="position:absolute; left:45%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;0.43</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">feet approximately. Since the static head was 34
feet, the head lost in friction was evidently</p>

<div style="position:relative;width:100%">
<p class="center">53-34&nbsp;=&nbsp;19</p>
<p style="text-indent:0;">feet, or</p>

<span style="position:absolute;left:45%">&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;36</span><br />
<span style="position:absolute;left:45%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">per cent., approximately.</p>


<h3>Supply of Cooling Water Limited</h3>

<p>In addition to this the supply of cooling water was
limited, the vacuum being extremely low at just the
time when efficient operation should be had. The
natural result occurred, which was this: As the load
on the turbine increased, the amount of steam issuing
into the condenser increased,
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber: heating?">beating</ins> the circulating
water to a temperature which the cooling tower (not
in the best condition) was unable to decrease to any
great extent. The vacuum gradually dropped off,
which indicated that the condenser was being filled
with vapor, and in a short time the small centrifugal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>tail-pump lost its prime, becoming "vapor bound,"
and the vacuum further decreased. The steam which
had condensed would not go into the tail-pump
because of the tendency of the dry-pump to maintain
a vacuum. When a certain point was reached the
dry-vacuum pump started to draw water in its cylinder,
and the unit had to be shut down immediately.</p>


<h3>Vapor-bound Pumps</h3>

<p>As the circulating water gradually rose in temperature
the circulating pump also became "vapor bound,"
so that the unit would be tied up for the rest of the
night, as this pump could not be made to draw hot
water. The reason for this condition may be explained
in the following way. When the circulating
pump was operating and there was a suction of 2
pounds indicated at <i>G</i>, the water was not flowing to
the pump of its own accord, but was being pulled
through by force. This water would flow through
the pump until a point was reached when the water
became hot enough to be converted into vapor, this
occurring at a point where the pressure was sufficiently
reduced to cause the water to boil. Naturally this
point was in the suction pipe and vapor was thus
maintained behind the pump as long as it was operating.
In this case the pump was merely maintaining
a partial vacuum, but not drawing water. After the
vacuum was once lost, by reason of the facts given,
it could not be regained, as the circulating water,
piping and condenser required a considerable period
of time in which to cool.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>Before any radical changes were made it was decided
that a man should crawl in the suction pipe <i>A</i>,
and remove such sand, dirt, or any other obstacles
as were believed to cause the friction. After this
had been done and considerable sand had been removed,
tests were resumed with practically the same
results as before. The investigation was continued
and the dry-vacuum pumps were overhauled, as they
had been damaged by water in the cylinders, and
furthermore needed re-boring. In short, the auxiliaries
were restored to the best condition that could
be brought about by the individual improvement
of each piece of apparatus. As this was not the seat
of the trouble, however, the remedy failed to effect
a "cure." It was demonstrated that the steam consumption
of the turbines was greatly increased due
to priming of the boilers, as well as condensation in
the turbine casing; hence, the ills above mentioned
were aggravated.</p>


<h3>Changes in Piping</h3>

<p>After a great deal of argument from the chief engineer,
and the firm which furnished the pump, both
making a strong plea for a change in the piping, the
company accepted the inevitable, and the dotted
portion shows the present layout. The elbow <i>M</i> was
removed, and a tee put in its place to which the
piping <i>D</i> was connected. The circulating pump was
removed to the position shown, and a direct connection
substituted for the S-bend. The discharge pipe
<i>C</i> was carried from No. 1 unit separately, as shown
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
in the elevation, and terminated at No. 1 cooling tower
instead of No. 2, which shortened the distance about
60 feet, the total length of pipe (one way) from No. 1
unit being originally 250 feet. In this way the condensing
equipment was made practically separate for
each turbine, as it should have been in the first place.</p>

<p>With the new piping a vacuum of 24 inches on the
peak could be reached. While this is far from an efficient
value, yet it is better than the former figure.
The failure to reach a vacuum of 28 inches or better
is due primarily to a lack of cooling water, but an
improvement in this regard could be made by reconstructing
the cooling towers, which at present do
not offer the proper amount of cooling surface. The
screens used were heavy galvanized wire of about 3/16-inch
mesh, which became coated in a short time, and
must be thoroughly cleaned to permit the water to
drop through them. The supply of cooling water
was taken from a 30-inch pipe line several miles long
and fed from a spring. The amount of water varied
considerably and was at times quite insufficient for
the load on the plant. Instead of meeting this condition
with the best apparatus possible, a chain of
difficulties were added to it, with the results given.</p>
